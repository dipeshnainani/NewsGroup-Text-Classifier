begin pgp signed message an introduction to atheism by mathew mathewmantiscoukthis article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism whilst ihave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues youshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint iwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions somerelevant books are listed in a companion articleto provide a sense of cohesion and progression i have presented this articleas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist all thequestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been croppedup repeatedly on altatheism since the newsgroup was created some otherfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion articleplease note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questionsposed from a christian viewpoint this is because the faq files reflectquestions which have actually been asked and it is predominantly christianswho proselytize on altatheismso when i talk of religion i am talking primarily about religions such aschristianity judaism and islam which involve some sort of superhuman divinebeing much of the discussion will apply to other religions but some of itmay notwhat is atheismatheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of godsome atheists go further and believe that god does not exist the former isoften referred to as the weak atheist position and the latter as strongatheismit is important to note the difference between these two positions weakatheism is simple scepticism disbelief in the existence of god strongatheism is a positive belief that god does not exist please do notfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are strong atheistssome atheists believe in the nonexistence of all gods others limit theiratheism to specific gods such as the christian god rather than makingflatout denialsbut isnt disbelieving in god the same thing as believing he doesnt existdefinitely not disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believeit to be true not believing that something is true is not equivalent tobelieving that it is false one may simply have no idea whether it is true ornot which brings us to agnosticismwhat is agnosticism thenthe term agnosticism was coined by professor huxley at a meeting of themetaphysical society in he defined an agnostic as someone whodisclaimed strong atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of thingsmust be some cause unknown and unknowablethus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know forsure whether god existswords are slippery things and language is inexact beware of assuming thatyou can work out someones philosophical point of view simply from the factthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic for example many peopleuse agnosticism to mean weak atheism and use the word atheism only whenreferring to strong atheismbeware also that because the word atheist has so many shades of meaning itis very difficult to generalize about atheists about all you can say forsure is that atheists dont believe in god for example it certainly isntthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find outabout the universeso what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheismthere are many philosophical justifications for atheism to find out why aparticular person chooses to be an atheist its best to ask hermany atheists feel that the idea of god as presented by the major religionsis essentially selfcontradictory and that it is logically impossible thatsuch a god could exist others are atheists through scepticism because theysee no evidence that god existsbut isnt it impossible to prove the nonexistence of somethingthere are many counterexamples to such a statement for example it isquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger thanall other prime numbers of course this deals with welldefined objectsobeying welldefined rules whether gods or universes are similarlywelldefined is a matter for debatehowever assuming for the moment that the existence of a god is not provablyimpossible there are still subtle reasons for assuming the nonexistence ofgod if we assume that something does not exist it is always possible toshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counterexampleif on the other hand we assume that something does exist and if the thing inquestion is not provably impossible showing that the assumption is invalidmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thingmight be found to show that it isnt there such an exhaustive search isoften impractical or impossible there is no such problem with largestprimes because we can prove that they dont existtherefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not existunless we have evidence that they do even theists follow this rule most ofthe time they dont believe in unicorns even though they cant conclusivelyprove that no unicorns exist anywhereto assume that god exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot betested we cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere god might be toprove that he doesnt exist anywhere so the sceptical atheist assumes bydefault that god does not exist since that is an assumption we can testthose who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of godexists instead they generally restrict their claims so as to covervarieties of god described by followers of various religions so whilst itmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no god exists it may bepossible to prove that say a god as described by a particular religiousbook does not exist it may even be possible to prove that no god describedby any presentday religion existsin practice believing that no god described by any religion exists is veryclose to believing that no god exists however it is sufficiently differentthat counterarguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind ofgod are not really applicablebut what if god is essentially nondetectableif god interacts with our universe in any way the effects of his interactionmust be measurable hence his interaction with our universe must bedetectableif god is essentially nondetectable it must therefore be the case that hedoes not interact with our universe in any way many atheists would arguethat if god does not interact with our universe at all it is of noimportance whether he exists or notif the bible is to be believed god was easily detectable by the israelitessurely he should still be detectable todaynote that i am not demanding that god interact in a scientificallyverifiable physical way it must surely be possible to perceive someeffect caused by his presence though otherwise how can i distinguish himfrom all the other things that dont existok you may think theres a philosophical justification for atheism but isnt it still a religious beliefone of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is theperson a begins by making a contentious statement when person b points outthat it cant be true person a gradually redefines the words he used in thestatement until he arrives at something person b is prepared to accept hethen records the statement along with the fact that person b has agreed toit and continues eventually a uses the statement as an agreed fact butuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscureredefinitions originally needed to get b to agree to it rather than be seento be apparently inconsistent b will tend to play alongthe point of this digression is that the answer to the question isntatheism a religious belief depends crucially upon what is meant byreligious religion is generally characterized by belief in a superhumancontrolling power especially in some sort of god and by faith andworship its worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of buddhism are not religion according to such a definition atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power nor is itcategorized by worship in any meaningful sense widening the definition ofreligious to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects ofhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as religious as well such asscience politics and watching tvok so its not a religion but surely belief in atheism or science is still just an act of faith like religion isfirstly its not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something oneactually believes insecondly it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions tomake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience most atheiststry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible and even those are subject toquestioning if experience throws them into doubtscience has a number of core assumptions for example it is generallyassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers these arethe sort of core assumptions atheists make if such basic ideas are calledacts of faith then almost everything we know must be said to be based onacts of faith and the term loses its meaningfaith is more often used to refer to complete certain belief in somethingaccording to such a definition atheism and science are certainly not acts offaith of course individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic asreligious followers when claiming that something is certain this is not ageneral tendency however there are many atheists who would be reluctant tostate with certainty that the universe existsfaith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proofsceptical atheism certainly doesnt fit that definition as sceptical atheismhas no beliefs strong atheism is closer but still doesnt really match aseven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data orthe lack of it when asserting that god does not existif atheism is not religious surely its antireligiousit is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either for oragainst friend or enemy the truth is not so clearcutatheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism in that senseit can be said to be antireligion however when religious believersspeak of atheists being antireligious they usually mean that the atheistshave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theiststhis categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfairatheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrummost atheists take a live and let live attitude unless questioned theywill not usually mention their atheism except perhaps to close friends ofcourse this may be in part because atheism is not socially acceptable inmany countriesa few atheists are quite antireligious and may even try to convert otherswhen possible historically such antireligious atheists have made littleimpact on society outside the eastern bloc countriesof church and state just like the usa soviet citizens were legally free toworship as they wished the institution of state atheism came about whenstalin took control of the soviet union and tried to destroy the churches inorder to gain complete power over the populationsome atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs but only where they seereligion encroaching on matters which are not its business for examplethe government of the usa such individuals are usually concerned thatchurch and state should remain separatebut if you dont allow religion to have a say in the running of the state surely thats the same as state atheismthe principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shallnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief in particular itmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense ofanother but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious innaturereligions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters forexample religious believers have historically been responsible forencouraging many political reforms even today many organizationscampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded asreligious campaigns so long as they campaign concerning secular mattersand so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds most atheistsare quite happy to see them have their saywhat about prayer in schools if theres no god why do you care if people praybecause people who do pray are voters and lawmakers and tend to do thingsthat those who dont pray cant just ignore also christian prayer inschools is intimidating to nonchristians even if they are told that theyneed not join in the diversity of religious and nonreligious belief meansthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will beacceptable to all those present at any public eventalso nonprayers tend to have friends and family who pray it is reasonableto care about friends and family wasting their time even without othermotivesyou mentioned christians who campaign for increased foreign aid what about atheists why arent there any atheist charities or hospitals dont atheists object to the religious charitiesthere are many charities without religious purpose that atheists cancontribute to some atheists contribute to religious charities as well forthe sake of the practical good they do some atheists even do voluntary workfor charities founded on a theistic basismost atheists seem to feel that atheism isnt worth shouting about inconnection with charity to them atheism is just a simple obvious everydaymatter and so is charity many feel that its somewhat cheap not to sayselfrighteous to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular setof religious beliefsto weak atheists building a hospital to say i do not believe in god is arather strange idea its rather like holding a party to say today is not mybirthday why the fuss atheism is rarely evangelicalyou said atheism isnt antireligious but is it perhaps a backlash against ones upbringing a way of rebellingperhaps it is for some but many people have parents who do not attempt toforce any religious or atheist ideas upon them and many of those peoplechoose to call themselves atheistsits also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as abacklash against an atheist upbringing as a way of being different on theother hand many people choose religion as a way of conforming to theexpectations of otherson the whole we cant conclude much about whether atheism or religion arebacklash or conformism although in general people have a tendency to goalong with a group rather than act or think independentlyhow do atheists differ from religious peoplethey dont believe in god thats all there is to itatheists may listen to heavy metal backwards even or they may prefer averdi requiem even if they know the words they may wear hawaiian shirtsthey may dress all in black they may even wear orange robes manybuddhists lack a belief in any sort of god some atheists even carry a copyof the bible around for arguing against of coursewhoever you are the chances are you have met several atheists withoutrealising it atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour andappearanceunexceptional but arent atheists less moral than religious peoplethat depends if you define morality as obedience to god then of courseatheists are less moral as they dont obey any god but usually when onetalks of morality one talks of what is acceptable right and unacceptablewrong behaviour within societyhumans are social animals and to be maximally successful they mustcooperate with each other this is a good enough reason to discourage mostatheists from antisocial or immoral behaviour purely for the purposesof selfpreservationmany atheists behave in a moral or compassionate way simply because theyfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans so why do they carewhat happens to others they dont know they simply are that waynaturally there are some people who behave immorally and try to useatheism to justify their actions however there are equally many people whobehave immorally and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their came into the world to save sinners but for that very reason i was shown mercy so that in me jesus christ might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life now to the king eternal immortal invisible the only god be honor and glory forever and everthe above quote is from a statement made to the court on february th by jeffrey dahmer the notorious cannibal serial killer of milwaukeewisconsin it seems that for every atheist massmurderer there is areligious massmurderer but what of more trivial morality a survey conducted by the roper organization found that behavior deteriorated after born again experiences while only of respondents said they had driven intoxicated before being born again had done so after conversion similarly had used illegal drugs before conversion after two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex before salvation after freethought today september p so it seems that at best religion does not have a monopoly on moralbehaviouris there such a thing as atheist moralityif you mean is there such a thing as morality for atheists then theanswer is yes as explained above many atheists have ideas about moralitywhich are at least as strong as those held by religious peopleif you mean does atheism have a characteristic moral code then the answeris no atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a personwill behave most atheists follow many of the same moral rules as theistsbut for different reasons atheists view morality as something created

to be able to believe in god but so what shouldone believe things merely because one wants them to be true the risks ofsuch an approach should be obvious atheists often decide that wanting tobelieve something is not enough there must be evidence for the beliefbut of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of god they are unwilling in their souls to seemany if not most atheists were previously religious as has been explainedabove the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that godexists many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach godof course it is true that some atheists lack an open mind but assuming thatall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closedmindedcomments such as of course god is there you just arent looking properlyare likely to be viewed as patronizingcertainly if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it isvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they arebeing sincere if they say that they have searched for god if you are notwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth debate isfutileisnt the whole of life completely pointless to an atheistmany atheists live a purposeful life they decide what they think givesmeaning to life and they pursue those goals they try to make their livescount not by wishing for eternal life but by having an influence on otherpeople who will live on for example an atheist may dedicate his life topolitical reform in the hope of leaving his mark on historyit is a natural human tendency to look for meaning or purpose in randomevents however it is by no means obvious that life is the sort of thingthat has a meaningto put it another way not everything which looks like a question is actuallya sensible thing to ask some atheists believe that asking what is themeaning of life is as silly as asking what is the meaning of a cup ofcoffee they believe that life has no purpose or meaning it just isso how do atheists find comfort in time of dangerthere are many ways of obtaining comfort from family friends or even petsor on a less spiritual level from food or drink or tvthat may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger but sowhat should individuals believe in things because they are comforting orshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might bein the end its a decision for the individual concerned most atheists areunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely becauseit makes them feel comfortable they put truth before comfort and considerthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy thats justhard luckdont atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrongthe short answer is no do youmany atheists have been atheists for years they have encountered manyarguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of god but they havefound all of it to be invalid or inconclusivethousands of years of religious belief havent resulted in any good proof ofthe existence of god atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikelyto be proved wrong in the immediate future and they stop worrying about itso why should theists question their beliefs dont the same arguments applyno because the beliefs being questioned are not similar weak atheism isthe sceptical default position to take it asserts nothing strong atheismis a negative belief theism is a very strong positive beliefatheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefsbecause of the very real harm they can cause not just to the believersbut to everyone elsewhat sort of harmreligion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind its notjust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildingsthink of all the time and effort spent building churches praying and so onimagine how that effort could be better spentmany theists believe in miracle healing there have been plenty of instancesof ill people being healed by a priest ceasing to take the medicinesprescribed to them by doctors and dying as a result some theists have diedbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious groundsit is arguable that the catholic churchs opposition to birth control andcondoms in particular is increasing the problem of overpopulation in manythirdworld countries and contributing to the spread of aids worldwidereligious believers have been known to murder their children rather thanallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a differentreligionthose werent real believers they just claimed to be believers as some sort of excusewhat makes a real believer there are so many one true religions its hardconvinced that they are the only true christians sometimes they even fightand kill each other how is an atheist supposed to decide whos a realchristian and who isnt when even the major christian churches like thecatholic church and the church of england cant decide amongst themselvesin the end most atheists take a pragmatic view and decide that anyone whocalls himself a christian and uses christian belief or dogma to justify hisactions should be considered a christian maybe some of those christiansare just perverting christian teaching for their own ends but surely ifthe bible can be so readily used to support unchristian acts it cant bemuch of a moral code if the bible is the word of god why couldnt he havemade it less easy to misinterpret and how do you know that your beliefsarent a perversion of what your god intendedif there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the bible then whyshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your saysosorry but if someone claims that he believes in jesus and that he murderedothers because jesus and the bible told him to do so we must call him achristianobviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned but since nobody has ever proved that god does not exist it must be very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs shared by all faiths are nonsensethat does not hold because as was pointed out at the start of this dialoguepositive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently muchharder to disprove than negative ones nobody has ever proved that unicornsdont exist but that doesnt make it unlikely that they are mythsit is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default thanit is to hold a positive assertion by default of course weak atheistswould argue that asserting nothing is better stillwell if atheisms so great why are there so many theistsunfortunately the popularity of a belief has little to do with how correctit is or whether it works consider how many people believe in astrologygraphology and other pseudosciencesmany atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe ingods certainly in many primitive human societies religion allows thepeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understandof course theres more to religion than that in the industrialized worldwe find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even whenthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations religion may have startedas a means of attempting to explain the world but nowadays it serves otherpurposes as wellbut so many cultures have developed religions surely that must say somethingnot really most religions are only superficially similar for example itsworth remembering that religions such as buddhism and taoism lack any sort ofconcept of god in the christian senseof course most religions are quick to denounce competing religions so itsrather odd to use one religion to try and justify anotherwhat about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded that god existsfor every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god there is one whodoes not besides as has already been pointed out the truth of a belief isnot determined by how many people believe it also it is important torealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in thesame way that theists view their religious leadersa famous scientist is only human she may be an expert in some fields butwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight manyrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking onsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertiseso are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothingnot entirely it certainly indicates that the religion in question hasproperties which have helped it so spread so farthe theory of memetics talks of memes sets of ideas which can propagatethemselves between human minds by analogy with genes some atheists viewreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes which spread byencouraging their hosts to convert others some memes avoid destruction bydiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine or by using peer pressureto keep onetime believers from admitting that they were mistaken somereligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled byother memesof course in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated withsuccessful propagation of a meme religion is not a good thing because ofthe number of people who believe it any more than a disease is a good thingbecause of the number of people who have caught iteven if religion is not entirely true at least it puts across important messages what are the fundamental messages of atheismthere are many important ideas atheists promote the following are just afew of them dont be surprised to see ideas which are also present in somereligions there is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules be especially sceptical of positive claims if you want your life to have some sort of meaning its up to you to find it search for what is true even if it makes you uncomfortable make the most of your life as its probably the only one youll have its no good relying on some external power to change you you must change yourself just because somethings popular doesnt mean its good if you must assume something assume something its easy to test dont believe things just because you want them to be true all beliefs should be open to questionthanks for taking

Introduction to Atheism                       by mathew <mathew@mantis.co.uk>This article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism.  Whilst Ihave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, youshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  Iwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; somerelevant books are listed in a companion article.To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this articleas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All thequestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been croppedup repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some otherfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questionsposed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflectquestions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christianswho proselytize on alt.atheism.So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such asChristianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divinebeing.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of itmay not."What is atheism?"Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former isoften referred to as the "weak atheist" position, and the latter as "strongatheism".It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  "Weakatheism" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  "Strongatheism" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do notfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are "strong atheists".Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit theiratheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than makingflat-out denials."But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?"Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believeit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent tobelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true ornot.  Which brings us to agnosticism."What is agnosticism then?"The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of theMetaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone whodisclaimed ("strong") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of thingsmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know forsure whether God exists.Words are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming thatyou can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the factthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many peopleuse agnosticism to mean "weak atheism", and use the word "atheism" only whenreferring to "strong atheism".Beware also that because the word "atheist" has so many shades of meaning, itis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say forsure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn'tthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find outabout the universe."So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?"There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why aparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religionsis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible thatsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because theysee no evidence that God exists."But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?"There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it isquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger thanall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objectsobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarlywell-defined is a matter for debate.However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provablyimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence ofGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible toshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.If on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing inquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalidmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thingmight be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search isoften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largestprimes, because we can prove that they don't exist.Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not existunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most ofthe time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusivelyprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot betested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be toprove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes bydefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of Godexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to covervarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst itmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may bepossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religiousbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God describedby any present-day religion exists.In practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is veryclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently differentthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind ofGod are not really applicable."But what if God is essentially non-detectable?"If God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interactionmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must bedetectable.If God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that hedoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would arguethat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of noimportance whether he exists or not.If the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.Surely he should still be detectable today?Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientificallyverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive someeffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish himfrom all the other things that don't exist?"OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but isn't it still a religious belief?"One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is "thePerson A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points outthat it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in thestatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  Hethen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed toit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an "agreed fact", butuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscureredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seento be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.The point of this digression is that the answer to the question "Isn'tatheism a religious belief?" depends crucially upon what is meant by"religious".  "Religion" is generally characterized by belief in a superhumancontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith andworship.[ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not  "religion" according to such a definition. ]Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is itcategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of"religious" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects ofhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as "religious" as well -- such asscience, politics, and watching TV."OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is still just an act of faith, like religion is?"Firstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something oneactually believes in.Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions tomake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheiststry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject toquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generallyassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These arethe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called"acts of faith", then almost everything we know must be said to be based onacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.Faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.According to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts offaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic asreligious followers when claiming that something is "certain".  This is not ageneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant tostate with certainty that the universe exists.Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.Sceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheismhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, aseven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (orthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist."If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?"It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either "for" or"against", "friend" or "enemy".  The truth is not so clear-cut.Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,it can be said to be "anti-religion".  However, when religious believersspeak of atheists being "anti-religious" they usually mean that the atheistshave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.Most atheists take a "live and let live" attitude.  Unless questioned, theywill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Ofcourse, this may be in part because atheism is not "socially acceptable" inmany countries.A few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to "convert" otherswhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made littleimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.of church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free toworship as they wished.  The institution of "state atheism" came about whenStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches inorder to gain complete power over the population.)Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they seereligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,the government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned thatchurch and state should remain separate."But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state, surely that's the same as state atheism?"The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shallnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, itmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense ofanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious innature.Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  Forexample, religious believers have historically been responsible forencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizationscampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded asreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheistsare quite happy to see them have their say."What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people pray?"Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do thingsthat those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer inschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that theyneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief meansthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will beacceptable to all those present at any public event.Also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonableto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without othermotives."You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't atheists object to the religious charities?"There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists cancontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, forthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary workfor charities founded on a theistic basis.Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about inconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everydaymatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to sayself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular setof religious beliefs.To "weak" atheists, building a hospital to say "I do not believe in God" is arather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say "Today is not mybirthday".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical."You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?"Perhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt toforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those peoplechoose to call themselves atheists.It's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as abacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On theother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to theexpectations of others.On the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion arebacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to goalong with a group rather than act or think independently."How do atheists differ from religious people?"They don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer aVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,they may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (ManyBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copyof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!Whoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists withoutrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour andappearance."Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?"That depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of courseatheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when onetalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable ("right") and unacceptable("wrong") behaviour within society.Humans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they mustco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage mostatheists from "anti-social" or "immoral" behaviour, purely for the purposesof self-preservation.Many atheists behave in a "moral" or "compassionate" way simply because theyfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they carewhat happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.Naturally, there are some people who behave "immorally" and try to useatheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people whobehave "immorally" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,   be honor and glory forever and ever."The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992by Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,Wisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is areligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior   deteriorated after "born again" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents   said they had driven intoxicated before being "born again," 12% had done   so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before   conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex   before salvation; 5% after.                                ["Freethought Today", September 1991, p. 12.]So it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moralbehaviour."Is there such a thing as atheist morality?"If you mean "Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?", then theanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about moralitywhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.If you mean "Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?", then the answeris no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a personwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same "moral rules" as theists,but for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created byhumans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, ratherthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being."Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?"A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of theatheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work forthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatiblewith what they observed around them.Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they areunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent timestudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They havemade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.This decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of thatindividual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choiceof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the onlychoice that person can honestly make."But don't atheists want to believe in God?"Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Manyof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the"Big Brother" figure might be.Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Shouldone believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks ofsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting tobelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief."But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are unwilling in their souls to see!"Many, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explainedabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that Godexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.Of course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming thatall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.Comments such as "Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properly"are likely to be viewed as patronizing.Certainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it isvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they arebeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are notwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate isfutile."Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?"Many atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think givesmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their livescount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on otherpeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life topolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.It is a natural human tendency to look for "meaning" or "purpose" in randomevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that "life" is the sort of thingthat has a "meaning".To put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actuallya sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking "What is themeaning of life?" is as silly as asking "What is the meaning of a cup ofcoffee?".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is."So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?"There are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.Or on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but sowhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, orshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?In the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists areunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely becauseit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and considerthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's justhard luck."Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?"The short answer is "No, do you?"Many atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered manyarguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they havefound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.Thousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof ofthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikelyto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it."So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments apply?"No, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism isthe sceptical "default position" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheismis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefsbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,but to everyone else."What sort of harm?"Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's notjust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;think of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.Imagine how that effort could be better spent.Many theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instancesof ill people being "healed" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicinesprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have diedbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.It is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- andcondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in manythird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather thanallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a differentreligion."Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some sort of excuse."What makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hardconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fightand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REALChristian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like theCatholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?In the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone whocalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify hisactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christiansare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely ifthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't bemuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he havemade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefsaren't a perversion of what your God intended?If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then whyshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?Sorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murderedothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him aChristian."Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense."That does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently muchharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicornsdon't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default thanit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, "weak" atheistswould argue that asserting nothing is better still."Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?"Unfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how "correct"it is, or whether it "works"; consider how many people believe in astrology,graphology, and other pseudo-sciences.Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe ingods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows thepeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.Of course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even whenthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have startedas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves otherpurposes as well."But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say something?"Not really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it'sworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort ofconcept of God in the Christian sense.Of course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it'srather odd to use one religion to try and justify another."What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded that God exists?"For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one whodoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief isnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important torealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in thesame way that theists view their religious leaders.A famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, butwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Manyrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking onsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise."So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothing?"Not entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question hasproperties which have helped it so spread so far.The theory of memetics talks of "memes" -- sets of ideas which can propagatethemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists viewreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread byencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction bydiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressureto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Somereligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled byother memes.Of course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated withsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because ofthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thingbecause of the number of people who have caught it."Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?"There are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just afew of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in somereligions.   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to   find it.   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.   Make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.   It's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change   yourself.   Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.   If you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.   Don't believe things just because you want them to be true.   All beliefs should be open to question.Thanks for taking the time to read this article.mathew-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----iQCVAgUBK8AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY4g7ge8Mo5wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO7ltVtMVTu66Nz6sBbPw9QkbjArbY/S2sZ9NF5htdii0R6SsEyPl0R6/9bV9okE/qnihqnzXE8pGvLt7tlez4EoeHZjXLEFrdEyPVayT54yQqGb4HARbOEHDcrTe2atmPq0Z4hSSPpAU==q2V5-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----For information about PGP 2.2, send mail to pgpinfo@mantis.co.uk.√ø, alt.atheism

However, they areconsidered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of Q as such, andnot an entirely different source.  >>Assuming that he knew Luke would obviously put him after Luke, and would>>give evidence for the latter assumption.>>I don't think this follows.  If you take the most traditional attributions,>then Luke might have known John, but John is an elder figure in either case.>We're talking spans of time here which are well within the range of>lifetimes. We are talking date of texts here, not the age of the authors. The usualexplanation for the time order of Mark, Matthew and Luke does not considertheir respective ages. It says Matthew has read the text of Mark, and Lukethat of Matthew (and probably that of Mark). As it is assumed that John knew the content of Luke's text. The evidencefor that is not overwhelming, admittedly.  >>>(1)  Earlier manuscripts of John have been discovered.>>>Interesting, where and which? How are they dated? How old are they?>>Unfortunately, I haven't got the info at hand.  It was (I think) in the late>'70s or early '80s, and it was possibly as old as CE 200.> When they are from about 200, why do they shed doubt on the order onputting John after the rest of the three?  >>I don't see your point, it is exactly what James Felder said.

The style and languagetogether with the theology are usually used as counterargument. The argument that John was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospelof John itself. Is there any other evidence for it? One step and one generation removed is bad even in our times. Compare thatto reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies.Not even to speak off that believers are not necessarily the best sources.  >>It is also obvious that Mark has been edited.

begin pgp signed message an introduction to atheism by mathew mathewmantiscoukthis article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism whilst ihave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues youshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint iwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions somerelevant books are listed in a companion articleto provide a sense of cohesion and progression i have presented this articleas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist all thequestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been croppedup repeatedly on altatheism since the newsgroup was created some otherfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion articleplease note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questionsposed from a christian viewpoint this is because the faq files reflectquestions which have actually been asked and it is predominantly christianswho proselytize on altatheismso when i talk of religion i am talking primarily about religions such aschristianity judaism and islam which involve some sort of superhuman divinebeing much of the discussion will apply to other religions but some of itmay notwhat is atheismatheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of godsome atheists go further and believe that god does not exist the former isoften referred to as the weak atheist position and the latter as strongatheismit is important to note the difference between these two positions weakatheism is simple scepticism disbelief in the existence of god strongatheism is a positive belief that god does not exist please do notfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are strong atheistssome atheists believe in the nonexistence of all gods others limit theiratheism to specific gods such as the christian god rather than makingflatout denialsbut isnt disbelieving in god the same thing as believing he doesnt existdefinitely not disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believeit to be true not believing that something is true is not equivalent tobelieving that it is false one may simply have no idea whether it is true ornot which brings us to agnosticismwhat is agnosticism thenthe term agnosticism was coined by professor huxley at a meeting of themetaphysical society in he defined an agnostic as someone whodisclaimed strong atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of thingsmust be some cause unknown and unknowablethus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know forsure whether god existswords are slippery things and language is inexact beware of assuming thatyou can work out someones philosophical point of view simply from the factthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic for example many peopleuse agnosticism to mean weak atheism and use the word atheism only whenreferring to strong atheismbeware also that because the word atheist has so many shades of meaning itis very difficult to generalize about atheists about all you can say forsure is that atheists dont believe in god for example it certainly isntthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find outabout the universeso what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheismthere are many philosophical justifications for atheism to find out why aparticular person chooses to be an atheist its best to ask hermany atheists feel that the idea of god as presented by the major religionsis essentially selfcontradictory and that it is logically impossible thatsuch a god could exist others are atheists through scepticism because theysee no evidence that god existsbut isnt it impossible to prove the nonexistence of somethingthere are many counterexamples to such a statement for example it isquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger thanall other prime numbers of course this deals with welldefined objectsobeying welldefined rules whether gods or universes are similarlywelldefined is a matter for debatehowever assuming for the moment that the existence of a god is not provablyimpossible there are still subtle reasons for assuming the nonexistence ofgod if we assume that something does not exist it is always possible toshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counterexampleif on the other hand we assume that something does exist and if the thing inquestion is not provably impossible showing that the assumption is invalidmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thingmight be found to show that it isnt there such an exhaustive search isoften impractical or impossible there is no such problem with largestprimes because we can prove that they dont existtherefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not existunless we have evidence that they do even theists follow this rule most ofthe time they dont believe in unicorns even though they cant conclusivelyprove that no unicorns exist anywhereto assume that god exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot betested we cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere god might be toprove that he doesnt exist anywhere so the sceptical atheist assumes bydefault that god does not exist since that is an assumption we can testthose who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of godexists instead they generally restrict their claims so as to covervarieties of god described by followers of various religions so whilst itmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no god exists it may bepossible to prove that say a god as described by a particular religiousbook does not exist it may even be possible to prove that no god describedby any presentday religion existsin practice believing that no god described by any religion exists is veryclose to believing that no god exists however it is sufficiently differentthat counterarguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind ofgod are not really applicablebut what if god is essentially nondetectableif god interacts with our universe in any way the effects of his interactionmust be measurable hence his interaction with our universe must bedetectableif god is essentially nondetectable it must therefore be the case that hedoes not interact with our universe in any way many atheists would arguethat if god does not interact with our universe at all it is of noimportance whether he exists or notif the bible is to be believed god was easily detectable by the israelitessurely he should still be detectable todaynote that i am not demanding that god interact in a scientificallyverifiable physical way it must surely be possible to perceive someeffect caused by his presence though otherwise how can i distinguish himfrom all the other things that dont existok you may think theres a philosophical justification for atheism but isnt it still a religious beliefone of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is theperson a begins by making a contentious statement when person b points outthat it cant be true person a gradually redefines the words he used in thestatement until he arrives at something person b is prepared to accept hethen records the statement along with the fact that person b has agreed toit and continues eventually a uses the statement as an agreed fact butuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscureredefinitions originally needed to get b to agree to it rather than be seento be apparently inconsistent b will tend to play alongthe point of this digression is that the answer to the question isntatheism a religious belief depends crucially upon what is meant byreligious religion is generally characterized by belief in a superhumancontrolling power especially in some sort of god and by faith andworship its worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of buddhism are not religion according to such a definition atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power nor is itcategorized by worship in any meaningful sense widening the definition ofreligious to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects ofhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as religious as well such asscience politics and watching tvok so its not a religion but surely belief in atheism or science is still just an act of faith like religion isfirstly its not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something oneactually believes insecondly it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions tomake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience most atheiststry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible and even those are subject toquestioning if experience throws them into doubtscience has a number of core assumptions for example it is generallyassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers these arethe sort of core assumptions atheists make if such basic ideas are calledacts of faith then almost everything we know must be said to be based onacts of faith and the term loses its meaningfaith is more often used to refer to complete certain belief in somethingaccording to such a definition atheism and science are certainly not acts offaith of course individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic asreligious followers when claiming that something is certain this is not ageneral tendency however there are many atheists who would be reluctant tostate with certainty that the universe existsfaith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proofsceptical atheism certainly doesnt fit that definition as sceptical atheismhas no beliefs strong atheism is closer but still doesnt really match aseven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data orthe lack of it when asserting that god does not existif atheism is not religious surely its antireligiousit is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either for oragainst friend or enemy the truth is not so clearcutatheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism in that senseit can be said to be antireligion however when religious believersspeak of atheists being antireligious they usually mean that the atheistshave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theiststhis categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfairatheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrummost atheists take a live and let live attitude unless questioned theywill not usually mention their atheism except perhaps to close friends ofcourse this may be in part because atheism is not socially acceptable inmany countriesa few atheists are quite antireligious and may even try to convert otherswhen possible historically such antireligious atheists have made littleimpact on society outside the eastern bloc countriesof church and state just like

they simply are that waynaturally there are some people who behave immorally and try to useatheism to justify their actions however there are equally many people whobehave immorally and then try to

that at best religion does not have a monopoly on moralbehaviouris there such a thing as atheist moralityif you mean is there such a thing as morality for atheists then theanswer is yes as explained above many atheists have ideas about moralitywhich are at least as strong as those held by religious peopleif you mean does atheism have a characteristic moral code then the answeris no atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a personwill behave most atheists follow many of the same moral rules as theistsbut for different reasons atheists view morality as something created byhumans according to the way humans feel the world ought to work ratherthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural beingthen arent atheists just theists who are denying goda study by the freedom from religion foundation found that over of theatheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work forthem they had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatiblewith what they observed around thematheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial they areunbelievers through choice the vast majority of them have spent timestudying one or more religions sometimes in very great depth they havemade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefsthis decision may of course be an inevitable consequence of thatindividuals personality for a naturally sceptical person the choiceof atheism is often the only one that makes sense and hence the onlychoice that person can honestly makebut dont atheists want to believe in godatheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them manyof them have no desire to be watched over no matter how goodnatured thebig brother figure might besome atheists would like to be able to believe in god but so what shouldone believe things merely because one wants them to be true the risks ofsuch an approach should be obvious atheists often decide that wanting tobelieve something is not enough there must be evidence for the beliefbut of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of god they are unwilling in their souls to seemany if not most atheists were previously religious as has been explainedabove the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that godexists many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach godof course it is true that some atheists lack an open mind but assuming thatall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closedmindedcomments such as of course god is there you just arent looking properlyare likely to be viewed as patronizingcertainly if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it isvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they arebeing sincere if they say that they have searched for god if you are notwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth debate isfutileisnt the whole of life completely pointless to an atheistmany atheists live a purposeful life they decide what they think givesmeaning to life and they pursue those goals they try to make their livescount not by wishing for eternal life but by having an influence on otherpeople who will live on for example an atheist may dedicate his life topolitical reform in the hope of leaving his mark on historyit is a natural human tendency to look for meaning or purpose in randomevents however it is by no means obvious that life is the sort of thingthat has a meaningto put it another way not everything which looks like a question is actuallya sensible thing to ask some atheists believe that asking what is themeaning of life is as silly as asking what is the meaning of a cup ofcoffee they believe that life has no purpose or meaning it just isso how do atheists find comfort in time of dangerthere are many ways of obtaining comfort from family friends or even petsor on a less spiritual level from food or drink or tvthat may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger but sowhat should individuals believe in things because they are comforting orshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might bein the end its a decision for the individual concerned most atheists areunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely becauseit makes them feel comfortable they put truth before comfort and considerthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy thats justhard luckdont atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrongthe short answer is no do youmany atheists have been atheists for years they have encountered manyarguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of god but they havefound all of it to be invalid or inconclusivethousands of years of religious belief havent resulted in any good proof ofthe existence of god atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikelyto be proved wrong in the immediate future and they stop worrying about itso why should theists question their beliefs dont the same arguments applyno because the beliefs being questioned are not similar weak atheism isthe sceptical default position to take it asserts nothing strong atheismis a negative belief theism is a very strong positive beliefatheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefsbecause of the very real harm they can cause not just to the believersbut to everyone elsewhat sort of harmreligion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind its notjust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildingsthink of all the time and effort spent building churches praying and so onimagine how that effort could be better spentmany theists believe in miracle healing there have been plenty of instancesof ill people being healed by a priest ceasing to take the medicinesprescribed to them by doctors and dying as a result some theists have diedbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious groundsit is arguable that the catholic churchs opposition to birth control andcondoms in particular is increasing the problem of overpopulation in manythirdworld countries and contributing to the spread of aids worldwidereligious believers have been known to murder their children rather thanallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a differentreligionthose werent real believers they just claimed to be believers as some sort of excusewhat makes a real believer there are so many one true religions its hardconvinced that they are the only true christians sometimes they even fightand kill each other how is an atheist supposed to decide whos a realchristian and who isnt when even the major christian churches like thecatholic church and the church of england cant decide amongst themselvesin the end most atheists take a pragmatic view and decide that anyone whocalls himself a christian and uses christian belief or dogma to justify hisactions should be considered a christian maybe some of those christiansare just perverting christian teaching for their own ends but surely ifthe bible can be so readily used to support unchristian acts it cant bemuch of a moral code if the bible is the word of god why couldnt he havemade it less easy to misinterpret and how do you know that your beliefsarent a perversion of what your god intendedif there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the bible then whyshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your saysosorry but if someone claims that he believes in jesus and that he murderedothers because jesus and the bible told him to do so we must call him achristianobviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned but since nobody has ever proved that god does not exist it must be very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs shared by all faiths are nonsensethat does not hold because as was pointed out at the start of this dialoguepositive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently muchharder to disprove than negative ones nobody has ever proved that unicornsdont exist but that doesnt make it unlikely that they are mythsit is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default thanit is to hold a positive assertion by default of course weak atheistswould argue that asserting nothing is better stillwell if atheisms so great why are there so many theistsunfortunately the popularity of a belief has little to do with how correctit is or whether it works consider how many people believe in astrologygraphology and other pseudosciencesmany atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe ingods certainly in many primitive human societies religion allows thepeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understandof course theres more to religion than that in the industrialized worldwe find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even whenthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations religion may have startedas a means of attempting to explain the world but nowadays it serves otherpurposes as wellbut so many cultures have developed religions surely that must say somethingnot really most religions are only superficially similar for example itsworth remembering that religions such as buddhism and taoism lack any sort ofconcept of god in the christian senseof course most religions are quick to denounce competing religions so itsrather odd to use one religion to try and justify anotherwhat about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded that god existsfor every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god there is one whodoes not besides as has already been pointed out the truth of a belief isnot determined by how many people believe it also it is important torealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in thesame way that theists view their religious leadersa famous scientist is only human she may be an expert in some fields butwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight manyrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking onsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertiseso are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothingnot entirely it certainly indicates that the religion in question hasproperties which have helped it so spread so farthe theory of memetics talks of memes sets of ideas which can propagatethemselves between human minds by analogy with genes some atheists viewreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes which spread byencouraging their hosts to convert others some memes avoid destruction bydiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine or by using peer pressureto keep onetime believers from admitting that they were mistaken somereligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled byother memesof course in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated withsuccessful propagation of a meme religion is not a good thing because ofthe number of people who believe it any more than a disease is a good thingbecause of the number of people who have caught iteven if religion is not entirely true at least it puts across important messages what are the fundamental messages of atheismthere are many important ideas atheists promote the following are just afew of them dont be surprised to see ideas which are also present in somereligions there is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules be especially sceptical of positive claims if you want your life to have some sort of meaning its up to you to find it search for what is true even if it makes you uncomfortable make the most of your life as its probably the only one youll have its no good relying on some external power to change you you must change yourself just because somethings popular doesnt mean its good if you must assume something assume something its easy to test dont believe things just because you want them to be true all beliefs should be open to questionthanks for taking

Introduction to Atheism                       by mathew <mathew@mantis.co.uk>This article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism.  Whilst Ihave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, youshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  Iwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; somerelevant books are listed in a companion article.To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this articleas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All thequestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been croppedup repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some otherfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questionsposed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflectquestions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christianswho proselytize on alt.atheism.So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such asChristianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divinebeing.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of itmay not."What is atheism?"Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former isoften referred to as the "weak atheist" position, and the latter as "strongatheism".It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  "Weakatheism" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  "Strongatheism" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do notfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are "strong atheists".Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit theiratheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than makingflat-out denials."But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?"Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believeit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent tobelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true ornot.  Which brings us to agnosticism."What is agnosticism then?"The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of theMetaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone whodisclaimed ("strong") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of thingsmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know forsure whether God exists.Words are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming thatyou can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the factthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many peopleuse agnosticism to mean "weak atheism", and use the word "atheism" only whenreferring to "strong atheism".Beware also that because the word "atheist" has so many shades of meaning, itis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say forsure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn'tthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find outabout the universe."So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?"There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why aparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religionsis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible thatsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because theysee no evidence that God exists."But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?"There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it isquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger thanall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objectsobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarlywell-defined is a matter for debate.However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provablyimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence ofGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible toshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.If on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing inquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalidmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thingmight be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search isoften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largestprimes, because we can prove that they don't exist.Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not existunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most ofthe time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusivelyprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot betested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be toprove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes bydefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of Godexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to covervarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst itmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may bepossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religiousbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God describedby any present-day religion exists.In practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is veryclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently differentthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind ofGod are not really applicable."But what if God is essentially non-detectable?"If God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interactionmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must bedetectable.If God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that hedoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would arguethat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of noimportance whether he exists or not.If the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.Surely he should still be detectable today?Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientificallyverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive someeffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish himfrom all the other things that don't exist?"OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but isn't it still a religious belief?"One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is "thePerson A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points outthat it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in thestatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  Hethen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed toit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an "agreed fact", butuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscureredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seento be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.The point of this digression is that the answer to the question "Isn'tatheism a religious belief?" depends crucially upon what is meant by"religious".  "Religion" is generally characterized by belief in a superhumancontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith andworship.[ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not  "religion" according to such a definition. ]Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is itcategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of"religious" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects ofhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as "religious" as well -- such asscience, politics, and watching TV."OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is still just an act of faith, like religion is?"Firstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something oneactually believes in.Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions tomake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheiststry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject toquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generallyassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These arethe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called"acts of faith", then almost everything we know must be said to be based onacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.Faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.According to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts offaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic asreligious followers when claiming that something is "certain".  This is not ageneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant tostate with certainty that the universe exists.Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.Sceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheismhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, aseven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (orthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist."If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?"It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either "for" or"against", "friend" or "enemy".  The truth is not so clear-cut.Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,it can be said to be "anti-religion".  However, when religious believersspeak of atheists being "anti-religious" they usually mean that the atheistshave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.Most atheists take a "live and let live" attitude.  Unless questioned, theywill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Ofcourse, this may be in part because atheism is not "socially acceptable" inmany countries.A few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to "convert" otherswhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made littleimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.of church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free toworship as they wished.  The institution of "state atheism" came about whenStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches inorder to gain complete power over the population.)Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they seereligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,the government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned thatchurch and state should remain separate."But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state, surely that's the same as state atheism?"The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shallnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, itmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense ofanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious innature.Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  Forexample, religious believers have historically been responsible forencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizationscampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded asreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheistsare quite happy to see them have their say."What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people pray?"Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do thingsthat those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer inschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that theyneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief meansthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will beacceptable to all those present at any public event.Also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonableto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without othermotives."You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't atheists object to the religious charities?"There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists cancontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, forthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary workfor charities founded on a theistic basis.Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about inconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everydaymatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to sayself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular setof religious beliefs.To "weak" atheists, building a hospital to say "I do not believe in God" is arather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say "Today is not mybirthday".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical."You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?"Perhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt toforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those peoplechoose to call themselves atheists.It's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as abacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On theother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to theexpectations of others.On the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion arebacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to goalong with a group rather than act or think independently."How do atheists differ from religious people?"They don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer aVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,they may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (ManyBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copyof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!Whoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists withoutrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour andappearance."Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?"That depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of courseatheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when onetalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable ("right") and unacceptable("wrong") behaviour within society.Humans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they mustco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage mostatheists from "anti-social" or "immoral" behaviour, purely for the purposesof self-preservation.Many atheists behave in a "moral" or "compassionate" way simply because theyfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they carewhat happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.Naturally, there are some people who behave "immorally" and try to useatheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people whobehave "immorally" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,   be honor and glory forever and ever."The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992by Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,Wisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is areligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior   deteriorated after "born again" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents   said they had driven intoxicated before being "born again," 12% had done   so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before   conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex   before salvation; 5% after.                                ["Freethought Today", September 1991, p. 12.]So it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moralbehaviour."Is there such a thing as atheist morality?"If you mean "Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?", then theanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about moralitywhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.If you mean "Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?", then the answeris no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a personwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same "moral rules" as theists,but for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created byhumans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, ratherthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being."Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?"A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of theatheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work forthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatiblewith what they observed around them.Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they areunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent timestudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They havemade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.This decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of thatindividual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choiceof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the onlychoice that person can honestly make."But don't atheists want to believe in God?"Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Manyof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the"Big Brother" figure might be.Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Shouldone believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks ofsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting tobelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief."But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are unwilling in their souls to see!"Many, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explainedabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that Godexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.Of course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming thatall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.Comments such as "Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properly"are likely to be viewed as patronizing.Certainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it isvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they arebeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are notwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate isfutile."Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?"Many atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think givesmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their livescount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on otherpeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life topolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.It is a natural human tendency to look for "meaning" or "purpose" in randomevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that "life" is the sort of thingthat has a "meaning".To put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actuallya sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking "What is themeaning of life?" is as silly as asking "What is the meaning of a cup ofcoffee?".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is."So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?"There are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.Or on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but sowhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, orshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?In the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists areunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely becauseit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and considerthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's justhard luck."Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?"The short answer is "No, do you?"Many atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered manyarguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they havefound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.Thousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof ofthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikelyto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it."So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments apply?"No, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism isthe sceptical "default position" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheismis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefsbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,but to everyone else."What sort of harm?"Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's notjust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;think of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.Imagine how that effort could be better spent.Many theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instancesof ill people being "healed" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicinesprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have diedbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.It is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- andcondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in manythird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather thanallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a differentreligion."Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some sort of excuse."What makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hardconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fightand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REALChristian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like theCatholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?In the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone whocalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify hisactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christiansare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely ifthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't bemuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he havemade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefsaren't a perversion of what your God intended?If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then whyshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?Sorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murderedothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him aChristian."Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense."That does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently muchharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicornsdon't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default thanit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, "weak" atheistswould argue that asserting nothing is better still."Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?"Unfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how "correct"it is, or whether it "works"; consider how many people believe in astrology,graphology, and other pseudo-sciences.Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe ingods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows thepeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.Of course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even whenthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have startedas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves otherpurposes as well."But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say something?"Not really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it'sworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort ofconcept of God in the Christian sense.Of course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it'srather odd to use one religion to try and justify another."What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded that God exists?"For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one whodoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief isnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important torealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in thesame way that theists view their religious leaders.A famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, butwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Manyrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking onsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise."So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothing?"Not entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question hasproperties which have helped it so spread so far.The theory of memetics talks of "memes" -- sets of ideas which can propagatethemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists viewreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread byencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction bydiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressureto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Somereligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled byother memes.Of course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated withsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because ofthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thingbecause of the number of people who have caught it."Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?"There are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just afew of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in somereligions.   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to   find it.   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.   Make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.   It's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change   yourself.   Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.   If you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.   Don't believe things just because you want them to be true.   All beliefs should be open to question.Thanks for taking the time to read this article.mathew-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----iQCVAgUBK8AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY4g7ge8Mo5wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO7ltVtMVTu66Nz6sBbPw9QkbjArbY/S2sZ9NF5htdii0R6SsEyPl0R6/9bV9okE/qnihqnzXE8pGvLt7tlez4EoeHZjXLEFrdEyPVayT54yQqGb4HARbOEHDcrTe2atmPq0Z4hSSPpAU==q2V5-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----For information about PGP 2.2, send mail to pgpinfo@mantis.co.uk.√ø-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----                          An Introduction to Atheism                       by mathew <mathew@mantis.co.uk>This article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism.  Whilst Ihave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, youshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  Iwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; somerelevant books are listed in a companion article.To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this articleas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All thequestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been croppedup repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some otherfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questionsposed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflectquestions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christianswho proselytize on alt.atheism.So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such asChristianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divinebeing.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of itmay not."What is atheism?"Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former isoften referred to as the "weak atheist" position, and the latter as "strongatheism".It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  "Weakatheism" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  "Strongatheism" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do notfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are "strong atheists".Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit theiratheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than makingflat-out denials."But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?"Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believeit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent tobelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true ornot.  Which brings us to agnosticism."What is agnosticism then?"The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of theMetaphysical Society in     .  He defined an agnostic as someone whodisclaimed ("strong") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of thingsmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know forsure whether God exists.Words are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming thatyou can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the factthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many peopleuse agnosticism to mean "weak atheism", and use the word "atheism" only whenreferring to "strong atheism".Beware also that because the word "atheist" has so many shades of meaning, itis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say forsure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn'tthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find outabout the universe."So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?"There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why aparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religionsis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible thatsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because theysee no evidence that God exists."But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?"There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it isquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger thanall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objectsobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarlywell-defined is a matter for debate.However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provablyimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence ofGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible toshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.If on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing inquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalidmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thingmight be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search isoften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largestprimes, because we can prove that they don't exist.Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not existunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most ofthe time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusivelyprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot betested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be toprove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes bydefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of Godexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to covervarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst itmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may bepossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religiousbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God describedby any present-day religion exists.In practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is veryclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently differentthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind ofGod are not really applicable."But what if God is essentially non-detectable?"If God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interactionmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must bedetectable.If God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that hedoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would arguethat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of noimportance whether he exists or not.If the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.Surely he should still be detectable today?Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientificallyverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive someeffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish himfrom all the other things that don't exist?"OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but isn't it still a religious belief?"One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is "thePerson A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points outthat it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in thestatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  Hethen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed toit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an "agreed fact", butuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscureredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seento be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.The point of this digression is that the answer to the question "Isn'tatheism a religious belief?" depends crucially upon what is meant by"religious".  "Religion" is generally characterized by belief in a superhumancontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith andworship.[ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not  "religion" according to such a definition. ]Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is itcategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of"religious" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects ofhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as "religious" as well -- such asscience, politics, and watching TV."OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is still just an act of faith, like religion is?"Firstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something oneactually believes in.Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions tomake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheiststry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject toquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generallyassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These arethe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called"acts of faith", then almost everything we know must be said to be based onacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.Faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.According to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts offaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic asreligious followers when claiming that something is "certain".  This is not ageneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant tostate with certainty that the universe exists.Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.Sceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheismhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, aseven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (orthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist."If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?"It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either "for" or"against", "friend" or "enemy".  The truth is not so clear-cut.Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,it can be said to be "anti-religion".  However, when religious believersspeak of atheists being "anti-religious" they usually mean that the atheistshave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.Most atheists take a "live and let live" attitude.  Unless questioned, theywill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Ofcourse, this may be in part because atheism is not "socially acceptable" inmany countries.A few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to "convert" otherswhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made littleimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.of church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free toworship as they wished.  The institution of "state atheism" came about whenStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches inorder to gain complete power over the population.)Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they seereligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,the government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned thatchurch and state should remain separate."But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state, surely that's the same as state atheism?"The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shallnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, itmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense ofanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious innature.Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  Forexample, religious believers have historically been responsible forencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizationscampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded asreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheistsare quite happy to see them have their say."What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people pray?"Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do thingsthat those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer inschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that theyneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief meansthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will beacceptable to all those present at any public event.Also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonableto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without othermotives."You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't atheists object to the religious charities?"There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists cancontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, forthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary workfor charities founded on a theistic basis.Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about inconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everydaymatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to sayself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular setof religious beliefs.To "weak" atheists, building a hospital to say "I do not believe in God" is arather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say "Today is not mybirthday".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical."You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?"Perhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt toforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those peoplechoose to call themselves atheists.It's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as abacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On theother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to theexpectations of others.On the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion arebacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to goalong with a group rather than act or think independently."How do atheists differ from religious people?"They don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer aVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,they may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (ManyBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copyof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!Whoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists withoutrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour andappearance."Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?"That depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of courseatheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when onetalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable ("right") and unacceptable("wrong") behaviour within society.Humans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they mustco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage mostatheists from "anti-social" or "immoral" behaviour, purely for the purposesof self-preservation.Many atheists behave in a "moral" or "compassionate" way simply because theyfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they carewhat happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.Naturally, there are some people who behave "immorally" and try to useatheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people whobehave "immorally" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,   be honor and glory forever and ever."The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February   th     by Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,Wisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is areligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior   deteriorated after "born again" experiences.  While only  % of respondents   said they had driven intoxicated before being "born again,"   % had done   so after conversion.  Similarly,  % had used illegal drugs before   conversion,  % after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex   before salvation;  % after.                                ["Freethought Today", September     , p.   .]So it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moralbehaviour."Is there such a thing as atheist morality?"If you mean "Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?", then theanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about moralitywhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.If you mean "Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?", then the answeris no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a personwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same "moral rules" as theists,but for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created byhumans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, ratherthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being."Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?"A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over   % of theatheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work forthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatiblewith what they observed around them.Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they areunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent timestudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They havemade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.This decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of thatindividual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choiceof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the onlychoice that person can honestly make."But don't atheists want to believe in God?"Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Manyof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the"Big Brother" figure might be.Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Shouldone believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks ofsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting tobelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief."But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are unwilling in their souls to see!"Many, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explainedabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that Godexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.Of course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming thatall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.Comments such as "Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properly"are likely to be viewed as patronizing.Certainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it isvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they arebeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are notwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate isfutile."Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?"Many atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think givesmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their livescount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on otherpeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life topolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.It is a natural human tendency to look for "meaning" or "purpose" in randomevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that "life" is the sort of thingthat has a "meaning".To put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actuallya sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking "What is themeaning of life?" is as silly as asking "What is the meaning of a cup ofcoffee?".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is."So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?"There are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.Or on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but sowhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, orshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?In the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists areunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely becauseit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and considerthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's justhard luck."Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?"The short answer is "No, do you?"Many atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered manyarguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they havefound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.Thousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof ofthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikelyto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it."So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments apply?"No, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism isthe sceptical "default position" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheismis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefsbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,but to everyone else."What sort of harm?"Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's notjust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;think of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.Imagine how that effort could be better spent.Many theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instancesof ill people being "healed" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicinesprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have diedbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.It is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- andcondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in manythird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather thanallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a differentreligion."Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some sort of excuse."What makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hardconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fightand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REALChristian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like theCatholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?In the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone whocalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify hisactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christiansare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely ifthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't bemuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he havemade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefsaren't a perversion of what your God intended?If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then whyshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?Sorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murderedothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him aChristian."Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense."That does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently muchharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicornsdon't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default thanit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, "weak" atheistswould argue that asserting nothing is better still."Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?"Unfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how "correct"it is, or whether it "works"; consider how many people believe in astrology,graphology, and other pseudo-sciences.Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe ingods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows thepeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.Of course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even whenthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have startedas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves otherpurposes as well."But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say something?"Not really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it'sworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort ofconcept of God in the Christian sense.Of course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it'srather odd to use one religion to try and justify another."What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded that God exists?"For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one whodoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief isnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important torealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in thesame way that theists view their religious leaders.A famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, butwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Manyrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking onsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise."So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothing?"Not entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question hasproperties which have helped it so spread so far.The theory of memetics talks of "memes" -- sets of ideas which can propagatethemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists viewreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread byencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction bydiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressureto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Somereligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled byother memes.Of course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated withsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because ofthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thingbecause of the number of people who have caught it."Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?"There are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just afew of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in somereligions.   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to   find it.   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.   Make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.   It's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change   yourself.   Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.   If you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.   Don't believe things just because you want them to be true.   All beliefs should be open to question.Thanks for taking the time to read this article.mathew-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----iQCVAgUBK AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY g ge Mo wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO ltVtMVTu  Nz sBbPw QkbjArbY/S sZ NF htdii R SsEyPl R / bV okE/qnihqnzXE pGvLt tlez EoeHZjXLEFrdEyPVayT  yQqGb HARbOEHDcrTe atmPq Z hSSPpAU==q V -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----For information about PGP  . , send mail to pgpinfo@mantis.co.uk.√ø-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----                          An Introduction to Atheism                       by mathew <mathew@mantis.co.uk>This article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism.  Whilst Ihave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, youshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  Iwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; somerelevant books are listed in a companion article.To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this articleas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All thequestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been croppedup repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some otherfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questionsposed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflectquestions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christianswho proselytize on alt.atheism.So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such asChristianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divinebeing.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of itmay not."What is atheism?"Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former isoften referred to as the "weak atheist" position, and the latter as "strongatheism".It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  "Weakatheism" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  "Strongatheism" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do notfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are "strong atheists".Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit theiratheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than makingflat-out denials."But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?"Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believeit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent tobelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true ornot.  Which brings us to agnosticism."What is agnosticism then?"The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of theMetaphysical Society in     .  He defined an agnostic as someone whodisclaimed ("strong") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of thingsmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know forsure whether God exists.Words are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming thatyou can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the factthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many peopleuse agnosticism to mean "weak atheism", and use the word "atheism" only whenreferring to "strong atheism".Beware also that because the word "atheist" has so many shades of meaning, itis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say forsure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn'tthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find outabout the universe."So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?"There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why aparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religionsis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible thatsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because theysee no evidence that God exists."But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?"There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it isquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger thanall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objectsobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarlywell-defined is a matter for debate.However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provablyimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence ofGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible toshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.If on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing inquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalidmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thingmight be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search isoften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largestprimes, because we can prove that they don't exist.Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not existunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most ofthe time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusivelyprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot betested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be toprove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes bydefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of Godexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to covervarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst itmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may bepossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religiousbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God describedby any present-day religion exists.In practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is veryclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently differentthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind ofGod are not really applicable."But what if God is essentially non-detectable?"If God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interactionmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must bedetectable.If God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that hedoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would arguethat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of noimportance whether he exists or not.If the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.Surely he should still be detectable today?Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientificallyverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive someeffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish himfrom all the other things that don't exist?"OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but isn't it still a religious belief?"One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is "thePerson A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points outthat it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in thestatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  Hethen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed toit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an "agreed fact", butuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscureredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seento be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.The point of this digression is that the answer to the question "Isn'tatheism a religious belief?" depends crucially upon what is meant by"religious".  "Religion" is generally characterized by belief in a superhumancontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith andworship.[ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not  "religion" according to such a definition. ]Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is itcategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of"religious" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects ofhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as "religious" as well -- such asscience, politics, and watching TV."OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is still just an act of faith, like religion is?"Firstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something oneactually believes in.Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions tomake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheiststry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject toquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generallyassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These arethe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called"acts of faith", then almost everything we know must be said to be based onacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.Faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.According to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts offaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic asreligious followers when claiming that something is "certain".  This is not ageneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant tostate with certainty that the universe exists.Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.Sceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheismhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, aseven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (orthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist."If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?"It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either "for" or"against", "friend" or "enemy".  The truth is not so clear-cut.Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,it can be said to be "anti-religion".  However, when religious believersspeak of atheists being "anti-religious" they usually mean that the atheistshave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.Most atheists take a "live and let live" attitude.  Unless questioned, theywill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Ofcourse, this may be in part because atheism is not "socially acceptable" inmany countries.A few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to "convert" otherswhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made littleimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.of church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free toworship as they wished.  The institution of "state atheism" came about whenStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches inorder to gain complete power over the population.)Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they seereligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,the government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned thatchurch and state should remain separate."But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state, surely that's the same as state atheism?"The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shallnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, itmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense ofanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious innature.Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  Forexample, religious believers have historically been responsible forencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizationscampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded asreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheistsare quite happy to see them have their say."What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people pray?"Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do thingsthat those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer inschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that theyneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief meansthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will beacceptable to all those present at any public event.Also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonableto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without othermotives."You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't atheists object to the religious charities?"There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists cancontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, forthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary workfor charities founded on a theistic basis.Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about inconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everydaymatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to sayself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular setof religious beliefs.To "weak" atheists, building a hospital to say "I do not believe in God" is arather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say "Today is not mybirthday".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical."You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?"Perhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt toforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those peoplechoose to call themselves atheists.It's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as abacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On theother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to theexpectations of others.On the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion arebacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to goalong with a group rather than act or think independently."How do atheists differ from religious people?"They don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer aVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,they may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (ManyBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copyof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!Whoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists withoutrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour andappearance."Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?"That depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of courseatheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when onetalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable ("right") and unacceptable("wrong") behaviour within society.Humans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they mustco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage mostatheists from "anti-social" or "immoral" behaviour, purely for the purposesof self-preservation.Many atheists behave in a "moral" or "compassionate" way simply because theyfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they carewhat happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.Naturally, there are some people who behave "immorally" and try to useatheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people whobehave "immorally" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,   be honor and glory forever and ever."The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February   th     by Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,Wisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is areligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior   deteriorated after "born again" experiences.  While only  % of respondents   said they had driven intoxicated before being "born again,"   % had done   so after conversion.  Similarly,  % had used illegal drugs before   conversion,  % after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex   before salvation;  % after.                                ["Freethought Today", September     , p.   .]So it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moralbehaviour."Is there such a thing as atheist morality?"If you mean "Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?", then theanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about moralitywhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.If you mean "Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?", then the answeris no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a personwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same "moral rules" as theists,but for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created byhumans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, ratherthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being."Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?"A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over   % of theatheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work forthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatiblewith what they observed around them.Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they areunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent timestudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They havemade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.This decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of thatindividual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choiceof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the onlychoice that person can honestly make."But don't atheists want to believe in God?"Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Manyof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the"Big Brother" figure might be.Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Shouldone believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks ofsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting tobelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief."But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are unwilling in their souls to see!"Many, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explainedabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that Godexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.Of course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming thatall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.Comments such as "Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properly"are likely to be viewed as patronizing.Certainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it isvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they arebeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are notwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate isfutile."Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?"Many atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think givesmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their livescount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on otherpeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life topolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.It is a natural human tendency to look for "meaning" or "purpose" in randomevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that "life" is the sort of thingthat has a "meaning".To put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actuallya sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking "What is themeaning of life?" is as silly as asking "What is the meaning of a cup ofcoffee?".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is."So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?"There are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.Or on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but sowhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, orshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?In the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists areunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely becauseit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and considerthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's justhard luck."Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?"The short answer is "No, do you?"Many atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered manyarguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they havefound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.Thousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof ofthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikelyto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it."So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments apply?"No, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism isthe sceptical "default position" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheismis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefsbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,but to everyone else."What sort of harm?"Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's notjust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;think of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.Imagine how that effort could be better spent.Many theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instancesof ill people being "healed" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicinesprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have diedbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.It is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- andcondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in manythird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather thanallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a differentreligion."Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some sort of excuse."What makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hardconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fightand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REALChristian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like theCatholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?In the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone whocalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify hisactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christiansare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely ifthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't bemuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he havemade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefsaren't a perversion of what your God intended?If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then whyshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?Sorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murderedothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him aChristian."Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense."That does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently muchharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicornsdon't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default thanit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, "weak" atheistswould argue that asserting nothing is better still."Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?"Unfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how "correct"it is, or whether it "works"; consider how many people believe in astrology,graphology, and other pseudo-sciences.Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe ingods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows thepeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.Of course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even whenthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have startedas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves otherpurposes as well."But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say something?"Not really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it'sworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort ofconcept of God in the Christian sense.Of course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it'srather odd to use one religion to try and justify another."What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded that God exists?"For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one whodoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief isnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important torealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in thesame way that theists view their religious leaders.A famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, butwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Manyrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking onsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise."So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothing?"Not entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question hasproperties which have helped it so spread so far.The theory of memetics talks of "memes" -- sets of ideas which can propagatethemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists viewreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread byencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction bydiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressureto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Somereligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled byother memes.Of course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated withsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because ofthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thingbecause of the number of people who have caught it."Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?"There are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just afew of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in somereligions.   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to   find it.   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.   Make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.   It's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change   yourself.   Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.   If you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.   Don't believe things just because you want them to be true.   All beliefs should be open to question.Thanks for taking the time to read this article.mathew-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----iQCVAgUBK AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY g ge Mo wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO ltVtMVTu  Nz sBbPw QkbjArbY/S sZ NF htdii R SsEyPl R / bV okE/qnihqnzXE pGvLt tlez EoeHZjXLEFrdEyPVayT  yQqGb HARbOEHDcrTe atmPq Z hSSPpAU==q V -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----For information about PGP  . , send mail to pgpinfo@mantis.co.uk.√ø, alt.atheism

In thiswork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for theexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and relyupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values andaesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, weredecisively rejected in Mackie's "The Miracle of Theism".  In the revisededition of "The Existence of God", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which hemakes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.J. L. MACKIE"The Miracle of Theism", OxfordThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principalarguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classicalphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, throughthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatementsof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses thosepositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as "replacements forGod" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - lessformalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly directwhen compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.JAMES A.

begin pgp signed message an introduction to atheism by mathew mathewmantiscoukthis article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism whilst ihave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues youshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint iwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions somerelevant books are listed in a companion articleto provide a sense of cohesion and progression i have presented this articleas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist all thequestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been croppedup repeatedly on altatheism since the newsgroup was created some otherfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion articleplease note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questionsposed from a christian viewpoint this is because the faq files reflectquestions which have actually been asked and it is predominantly christianswho proselytize on altatheismso when i talk of religion i am talking primarily about religions such aschristianity judaism and islam which involve some sort of superhuman divinebeing much of the discussion will apply to other religions but some of itmay notwhat is atheismatheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of godsome atheists go further and believe that god does not exist the former isoften referred to as the weak atheist position and the latter as strongatheismit is important to note the difference between these two positions weakatheism is simple scepticism disbelief in the existence of god strongatheism is a positive belief that god does not exist please do notfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are strong atheistssome atheists believe in the nonexistence of all gods others limit theiratheism to specific gods such as the christian god rather than makingflatout denialsbut isnt disbelieving in god the same thing as believing he doesnt existdefinitely not disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believeit to be true not believing that something is true is not equivalent tobelieving that it is false one may simply have no idea whether it is true ornot which brings us to agnosticismwhat is agnosticism thenthe term agnosticism was coined by professor huxley at a meeting of themetaphysical society in he defined an agnostic as someone whodisclaimed strong atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of thingsmust be some cause unknown and unknowablethus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know forsure whether god existswords are slippery things and language is inexact beware of assuming thatyou can work out someones philosophical point of view simply from the factthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic for example many peopleuse agnosticism to mean weak atheism and use the word atheism only whenreferring to strong atheismbeware also that because the word atheist has so many shades of meaning itis very difficult to generalize about atheists about all you can say forsure is that atheists dont believe in god for example it certainly isntthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find outabout the universeso what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheismthere are many philosophical justifications for atheism to find out why aparticular person chooses to be an atheist its best to ask hermany atheists feel that the idea of god as presented by the major religionsis essentially selfcontradictory and that it is logically impossible thatsuch a god could exist others are atheists through scepticism because theysee no evidence that god existsbut isnt it impossible to prove the nonexistence of somethingthere are many counterexamples to such a statement for example it isquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger thanall other prime numbers of course this deals with welldefined objectsobeying welldefined rules whether gods or universes are similarlywelldefined is a matter for debatehowever assuming for the moment that the existence of a god is not provablyimpossible there are still subtle reasons for assuming the nonexistence ofgod if we assume that something does not exist it is always possible toshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counterexampleif on the other hand we assume that something does exist and if the thing inquestion is not provably impossible showing that the assumption is invalidmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thingmight be found to show that it isnt there such an exhaustive search isoften impractical or impossible there is no such problem with largestprimes because we can prove that they dont existtherefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not existunless we have evidence that they do even theists follow this rule most ofthe time they dont believe in unicorns even though they cant conclusivelyprove that no unicorns exist anywhereto assume that god exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot betested we cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere god might be toprove that he doesnt exist anywhere so the sceptical atheist assumes bydefault that god does not exist since that is an assumption we can testthose who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of godexists instead they generally restrict their claims so as to covervarieties of god described by followers of various religions so whilst itmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no god exists it may bepossible to prove that say a god as described by a particular religiousbook does not exist it may even be possible to prove that no god describedby any presentday religion existsin practice believing that no god described by any religion exists is veryclose to believing that no god exists however it is sufficiently differentthat counterarguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind ofgod are not really applicablebut what if god is essentially nondetectableif god interacts with our universe in any way the effects of his interactionmust be measurable hence his interaction with our universe must bedetectableif god is essentially nondetectable it must therefore be the case that hedoes not interact with our universe in any way many atheists would arguethat if god does not interact with our universe at all it is of noimportance whether he exists or notif the bible is to be believed god was easily detectable by the israelitessurely he should still be detectable todaynote that i am not demanding that god interact in a scientificallyverifiable physical way it must surely be possible to perceive someeffect caused by his presence though otherwise how can i distinguish himfrom all the other things that dont existok you may think theres a philosophical justification for atheism but isnt it still a religious beliefone of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is theperson a begins by making a contentious statement when person b points outthat it cant be true person a gradually redefines the words he used in thestatement until he arrives at something person b is prepared to accept hethen records the statement along with the fact that person b has agreed toit and continues eventually a uses the statement as an agreed fact butuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscureredefinitions originally needed to get b to agree to it rather than be seento be apparently inconsistent b will tend to play alongthe point of this digression is that the answer to the question isntatheism a religious belief depends crucially upon what is meant byreligious religion is generally characterized by belief in a superhumancontrolling power especially in some sort of god and by faith andworship its worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of buddhism are not religion according to such a definition atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power nor is itcategorized by worship in any meaningful sense widening the definition ofreligious to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects ofhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as religious as well such asscience politics and watching tvok so its not a religion but surely belief in atheism or science is still just an act of faith like religion isfirstly its not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something oneactually believes insecondly it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions tomake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience most atheiststry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible and even those are subject toquestioning if experience throws them into doubtscience has a number of core assumptions for example it is generallyassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers these arethe sort of core assumptions atheists make if such basic ideas are calledacts of faith then almost everything we know must be said to be based onacts of faith and the term loses its meaningfaith is more often used to refer to complete certain belief in somethingaccording to such a definition atheism and science are certainly not acts offaith of course individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic asreligious followers when claiming that something is certain this is not ageneral tendency however there are many atheists who would be reluctant tostate with certainty that the universe existsfaith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proofsceptical atheism certainly doesnt fit that definition as sceptical atheismhas no beliefs strong atheism is closer but still doesnt really match aseven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data orthe lack of it when asserting that god does not existif atheism is not religious surely its antireligiousit is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either for oragainst friend or enemy the truth is not so clearcutatheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism in that senseit can be said to be antireligion however when religious believersspeak of atheists being antireligious they usually mean that the atheistshave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theiststhis categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfairatheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrummost atheists take a live and let live attitude unless questioned theywill not usually mention their atheism except perhaps to close friends ofcourse this may be in part because atheism is not socially acceptable inmany countriesa few atheists are quite antireligious and may even try to convert otherswhen possible historically such antireligious atheists have made littleimpact on society outside the eastern bloc countriesof church and state just like the usa soviet citizens were legally free toworship as they wished the institution of state atheism came about whenstalin took control of the soviet union and tried to destroy the churches inorder to gain complete power over the populationsome atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs but only where they seereligion encroaching on matters which are not its business for examplethe government of the usa such individuals are usually concerned thatchurch and state should remain separatebut if you dont allow religion to have a say in the running of the state surely thats the same as state atheismthe principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shallnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief in particular itmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense ofanother but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious innaturereligions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters forexample religious believers have historically been responsible forencouraging many political reforms even today many organizationscampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded asreligious campaigns so long as they campaign concerning secular mattersand so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds most atheistsare quite happy to see them have their saywhat about prayer in schools if theres no god why do you care if people praybecause people who do pray are voters and lawmakers and tend to do thingsthat those who dont pray cant just ignore also christian prayer inschools is intimidating to nonchristians even if they are told that theyneed not join in the diversity of religious and nonreligious belief meansthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will beacceptable to all those present at any public eventalso nonprayers tend to have friends and family who pray it is reasonableto care about friends and family wasting their time even without othermotivesyou mentioned christians who campaign for increased foreign aid what about atheists why arent there any atheist charities or hospitals dont atheists object to the religious charitiesthere are many charities without religious purpose that atheists cancontribute to some atheists contribute to religious charities as well forthe sake of the practical good they do some atheists even do voluntary workfor charities founded on a theistic basismost atheists seem to feel that atheism isnt worth shouting about inconnection with charity to them atheism is just a simple obvious everydaymatter and so is charity many feel that its somewhat cheap not to sayselfrighteous to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular setof religious beliefsto weak atheists building a hospital to say i do not believe in god is arather strange idea its rather like holding a party to say today is not mybirthday why the fuss atheism is rarely evangelicalyou said atheism isnt antireligious but is it perhaps a backlash against ones upbringing a way of rebellingperhaps it is for some but many people have parents who do not attempt toforce any religious or atheist ideas upon them and many of those peoplechoose to call themselves atheistsits also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as abacklash against an atheist upbringing as a way of being different on theother hand many people choose religion as a way of conforming to theexpectations of otherson the whole we cant conclude much about whether atheism or religion arebacklash or conformism although in general people have a tendency to goalong with a group rather than act or think independentlyhow do atheists differ from religious peoplethey dont believe in god thats all there is to itatheists may listen to heavy metal backwards even or they may prefer averdi requiem even if they know the words they may wear hawaiian shirtsthey may dress all in black they may even wear orange robes manybuddhists lack a belief in any sort of god some atheists even carry a copyof the bible around for arguing against of coursewhoever you are the chances are you have met several atheists withoutrealising it atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour andappearanceunexceptional but arent atheists less moral than religious peoplethat depends if you define morality as obedience to god then of courseatheists are less moral as they dont obey any god but usually when onetalks of morality one talks of what is acceptable right and unacceptablewrong behaviour within societyhumans are social animals and to be maximally successful they mustcooperate with each other this is a good enough reason to discourage mostatheists from antisocial or immoral behaviour purely for the purposesof selfpreservationmany atheists behave in a moral or compassionate way simply because theyfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans so why do they carewhat happens to others they dont know they simply are that waynaturally there are some people who behave immorally and try to useatheism to justify their actions however there are equally many people whobehave immorally and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their came into the world to save sinners but for that very reason i was shown mercy so that in me jesus christ might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life now to the king eternal immortal invisible the only god be honor and glory forever and everthe above quote is from a statement made to the court on february th by jeffrey dahmer the notorious cannibal serial killer of milwaukeewisconsin it seems that for every atheist massmurderer there is areligious massmurderer but what of more trivial morality a survey conducted by the roper organization found that behavior deteriorated after born again experiences while only of respondents said they had driven intoxicated before being born again had done so after conversion similarly had used illegal drugs before conversion after two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex before salvation after freethought today september p so it seems that at best religion does not have a monopoly on moralbehaviouris there such a thing as atheist moralityif you mean is there such a thing as morality for atheists then theanswer is yes as explained above many atheists have ideas about moralitywhich are at least as strong as those held by religious peopleif you mean does atheism have a characteristic moral code then the answeris no atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a personwill behave most atheists follow many of the same moral rules as theistsbut for different reasons atheists view morality as something created byhumans according to the way humans feel the world ought to work ratherthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural beingthen arent atheists just theists who are denying goda study by the freedom from religion foundation found that over of theatheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work forthem they had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatiblewith what they observed around thematheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial they areunbelievers through choice the vast majority of them have spent timestudying one or more religions sometimes in very great depth they havemade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefsthis decision may of course be an inevitable consequence of thatindividuals personality for a naturally sceptical person the choiceof atheism is often the only one that makes sense and hence the onlychoice that person can honestly makebut dont atheists want to believe in godatheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them manyof them have no desire to be watched over no matter how goodnatured thebig brother figure might besome atheists would like to be able to believe in god but so what shouldone believe things merely because one wants them to be true the risks ofsuch an approach should be obvious atheists often decide that wanting tobelieve something is not enough there must be evidence for the beliefbut of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of god they are unwilling in their souls to seemany if not most atheists were previously religious as has been explainedabove the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that godexists many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach godof course it is true that some atheists lack an open mind but assuming thatall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closedmindedcomments such as of course god is there you just arent looking properlyare likely to be viewed as patronizingcertainly if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it isvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they arebeing sincere if they say that they have searched for god if you are notwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth debate isfutileisnt the whole of life completely pointless to an atheistmany atheists live a purposeful life they decide what they think givesmeaning to life and they pursue those goals they try to make their livescount not by wishing for eternal life but by having an influence on otherpeople who will live on for example an atheist may dedicate his life topolitical reform in the hope of leaving his mark on historyit is a natural human tendency to look for meaning or purpose in randomevents however it is by no means obvious that life is the sort of thingthat has a meaningto put it another way not everything which looks like a question is actuallya sensible thing to ask some atheists believe that asking what is themeaning of life is as silly as asking what is the meaning of a cup ofcoffee they believe that life has no purpose or meaning it just isso how do atheists find comfort in time of dangerthere are many ways of obtaining comfort from family friends or even petsor on a less spiritual level from food or drink or tvthat may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger but sowhat should individuals believe in things because they are comforting orshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might bein the end its a decision for the individual concerned most atheists areunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely becauseit makes them feel comfortable they put truth before comfort and considerthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy thats justhard luckdont atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrongthe short answer is no do youmany atheists have been atheists for years they have encountered manyarguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of god but they havefound all of it to be invalid or inconclusivethousands of years of religious belief havent resulted in any good proof ofthe existence of god atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikelyto be proved wrong in the immediate future and they stop worrying about itso why should theists question their beliefs dont the same arguments applyno because the beliefs being questioned are not similar weak atheism isthe sceptical default position to take it asserts nothing strong atheismis a negative belief theism is a very strong positive beliefatheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefsbecause of the very real harm they can cause not just to the believersbut to everyone elsewhat sort of harmreligion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind its notjust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildingsthink of all the time and effort spent building churches praying and so onimagine how that effort could be better spentmany theists believe in miracle healing there have been plenty of instancesof ill people being healed by a priest ceasing to take the medicinesprescribed to them by doctors and dying as a result some theists have diedbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious groundsit is arguable that the catholic churchs opposition to birth control andcondoms in particular is increasing the problem of overpopulation in manythirdworld countries and contributing to the spread of aids worldwidereligious believers have been known to murder their children rather thanallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a differentreligionthose werent real believers they just claimed to be believers as some sort of excusewhat makes a real believer there are so many one true religions its hardconvinced that they are the only true christians sometimes they even fightand kill each other how is an atheist supposed to decide whos a realchristian and who isnt when even the major christian churches like thecatholic church and the church of england cant decide amongst themselvesin the end most atheists take a pragmatic view and decide that anyone whocalls himself a christian and uses christian belief or dogma to justify hisactions should be considered a christian maybe some of those christiansare just perverting christian teaching for their own ends but surely ifthe bible can be so readily used to support unchristian acts it cant bemuch of a moral code if the bible is the word of god why couldnt he havemade it less easy to misinterpret and how do you know that your beliefsarent a perversion of what your god intendedif there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the bible then whyshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your saysosorry but if someone claims that he believes in jesus and that he murderedothers because jesus and the bible told him to do so we must call him achristianobviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned but since nobody has ever proved that god does not exist it must be very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs shared by all faiths are nonsensethat does not hold because as was pointed out at the start of this dialoguepositive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently muchharder to disprove than negative ones nobody has ever proved that unicornsdont exist but that doesnt make it unlikely that they are mythsit is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default thanit is to hold a positive assertion by default of course weak atheistswould argue that asserting nothing is better stillwell if atheisms so great why are there so many theistsunfortunately the popularity of a belief has little to do with how correctit is or whether it works consider how many people believe in astrologygraphology and other pseudosciencesmany atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe ingods certainly in many primitive human societies religion allows thepeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understandof course theres more to religion than that in the industrialized worldwe find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even whenthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations religion may have startedas a means of attempting to explain the world but nowadays it serves otherpurposes as wellbut so many cultures have developed religions surely that must say somethingnot really most religions are only superficially similar for example itsworth remembering that religions such as buddhism and taoism lack any sort ofconcept of god in the christian senseof course most religions are quick to denounce competing religions so itsrather odd to use one religion to try and justify anotherwhat about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded that god existsfor every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god there is one whodoes not besides as has already been pointed out the truth of a belief isnot determined by how many people believe it also it is important torealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in thesame way that theists view their religious leadersa famous scientist is only human she may be an expert in some fields butwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight manyrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking onsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertiseso are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothingnot entirely it certainly indicates that the religion in question hasproperties which have helped it so spread so farthe theory of memetics talks of memes sets of ideas which can propagatethemselves between human minds by analogy with genes some atheists viewreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes which spread byencouraging their hosts to convert others some memes avoid destruction bydiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine or by using peer pressureto keep onetime believers from admitting that they were mistaken somereligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled byother memesof course in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated withsuccessful propagation of a meme religion is not a good thing because ofthe number of people who believe it any more than a disease is a good thingbecause of the number of people who have caught iteven if religion is not entirely true at least it puts across important messages what are the fundamental messages of atheismthere are many important ideas atheists promote the following are just afew of them dont be surprised to see ideas which are also present in somereligions there is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules be especially sceptical of positive claims if you want your life to have some sort of meaning its up to you to find it search for what is true even if it makes you uncomfortable make the most of your life as its probably the only one youll have its no good relying on some external power to change you you must change yourself just because somethings popular doesnt mean its good if you must assume something assume something its easy to test dont believe things just because you want them to be true all beliefs should be open to questionthanks for taking

This is because the FAQ files reflectquestions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christianswho proselytize on alt.atheism.So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such asChristianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divinebeing.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of itmay not."What is atheism?"Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former isoften referred to as the "weak atheist" position, and the latter as "strongatheism".It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  "Weakatheism" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  "Strongatheism" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do notfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are "strong atheists".Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit theiratheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than makingflat-out denials."But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?"Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believeit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent tobelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true ornot.  Which brings us to agnosticism."What is agnosticism then?"The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of theMetaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone whodisclaimed ("strong") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of thingsmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know forsure whether God exists.Words are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming thatyou can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the factthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many peopleuse agnosticism to mean "weak atheism", and use the word "atheism" only whenreferring to "strong atheism".Beware also that because the word "atheist" has so many shades of meaning, itis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say forsure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn'tthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find outabout the universe."So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?"There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why aparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religionsis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible thatsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because theysee no evidence that God exists."But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?"There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it isquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger thanall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objectsobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarlywell-defined is a matter for debate.However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provablyimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence ofGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible toshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.If on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing inquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalidmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thingmight be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search isoften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largestprimes, because we can prove that they don't exist.Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not existunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most ofthe time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusivelyprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot betested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be toprove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes bydefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of Godexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to covervarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst itmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may bepossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religiousbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God describedby any present-day religion exists.In practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is veryclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently differentthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind ofGod are not really applicable."But what if God is essentially non-detectable?"If God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interactionmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must bedetectable.If God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that hedoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would arguethat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of noimportance whether he exists or not.If the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.Surely he should still be detectable today?Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientificallyverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive someeffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish himfrom all the other things that don't exist?"OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but isn't it still a religious belief?"One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is "thePerson A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points outthat it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in thestatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  Hethen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed toit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an "agreed fact", butuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscureredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seento be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.The point of this digression is that the answer to the question "Isn'tatheism a religious belief?" depends crucially upon what is meant by"religious".  "Religion" is generally characterized by belief in a superhumancontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith andworship.[ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not  "religion" according to such a definition. ]Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is itcategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of"religious" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects ofhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as "religious" as well -- such asscience, politics, and watching TV."OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is still just an act of faith, like religion is?"Firstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something oneactually believes in.Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions tomake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheiststry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject toquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generallyassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These arethe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called"acts of faith", then almost everything we know must be said to be based onacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.Faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.According to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts offaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic asreligious followers when claiming that something is "certain".  This is not ageneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant tostate with certainty that the universe exists.Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.Sceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheismhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, aseven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (orthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist."If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?"It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either "for" or"against", "friend" or "enemy".  The truth is not so clear-cut.Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,it can be said to be "anti-religion".  However, when religious believersspeak of atheists being "anti-religious" they usually mean that the atheistshave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.Most atheists take a "live and let live" attitude.  Unless questioned, theywill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Ofcourse, this may be in part because atheism is not "socially acceptable" inmany countries.A few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to "convert" otherswhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made littleimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.of church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free toworship as they wished.  The institution of "state atheism" came about whenStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches inorder to gain complete power over the population.)Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they seereligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,the government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned thatchurch and state should remain separate."But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state, surely that's the same as state atheism?"The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shallnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, itmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense ofanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious innature.Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  Forexample, religious believers have historically been responsible forencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizationscampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded asreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheistsare quite happy to see them have their say."What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people pray?"Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do thingsthat those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer inschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that theyneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief meansthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will beacceptable to all those present at any public event.Also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonableto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without othermotives."You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't atheists object to the religious charities?"There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists cancontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, forthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary workfor charities founded on a theistic basis.Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about inconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everydaymatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to sayself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular setof religious beliefs.To "weak" atheists, building a hospital to say "I do not believe in God" is arather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say "Today is not mybirthday".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical."You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?"Perhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt toforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those peoplechoose to call themselves atheists.It's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as abacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On theother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to theexpectations of others.On the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion arebacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to goalong with a group rather than act or think independently."How do atheists differ from religious people?"They don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer aVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,they may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (ManyBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copyof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!Whoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists withoutrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour andappearance."Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?"That depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of courseatheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when onetalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable ("right") and unacceptable("wrong") behaviour within society.Humans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they mustco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage mostatheists from "anti-social" or "immoral" behaviour, purely for the purposesof self-preservation.Many atheists behave in a "moral" or "compassionate" way simply because theyfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they carewhat happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.Naturally, there are some people who behave "immorally" and try to useatheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people whobehave "immorally" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,   be honor and glory forever and ever."The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992by Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,Wisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is areligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior   deteriorated after "born again" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents   said they had driven intoxicated before being "born again," 12% had done   so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before   conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex   before salvation; 5% after.                                ["Freethought Today", September 1991, p. 12.]So it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moralbehaviour."Is there such a thing as atheist morality?"If you mean "Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?", then theanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about moralitywhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.If you mean "Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?", then the answeris no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a personwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same "moral rules" as theists,but for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created byhumans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, ratherthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being."Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?"A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of theatheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work forthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatiblewith what they observed around them.Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they areunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent timestudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They havemade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.This decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of thatindividual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choiceof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the onlychoice that person can honestly make."But don't atheists want to believe in God?"Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Manyof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the"Big Brother" figure might be.Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Shouldone believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks ofsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting tobelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief."But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are unwilling in their souls to see!"Many, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explainedabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that Godexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.Of course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming thatall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.Comments such as "Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properly"are likely to be viewed as patronizing.Certainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it isvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they arebeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are notwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate isfutile."Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?"Many atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think givesmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their livescount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on otherpeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life topolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.It is a natural human tendency to look for "meaning" or "purpose" in randomevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that "life" is the sort of thingthat has a "meaning".To put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actuallya sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking "What is themeaning of life?" is as silly as asking "What is the meaning of a cup ofcoffee?".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is."So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?"There are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.Or on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but sowhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, orshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?In the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists areunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely becauseit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and considerthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's justhard luck."Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?"The short answer is "No, do you?"Many atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered manyarguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they havefound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.Thousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof ofthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikelyto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it."So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments apply?"No, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism isthe sceptical "default position" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheismis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefsbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,but to everyone else."What sort of harm?"Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's notjust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;think of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.Imagine how that effort could be better spent.Many theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instancesof ill people being "healed" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicinesprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have diedbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.It is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- andcondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in manythird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather thanallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a differentreligion."Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some sort of excuse."What makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hardconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fightand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REALChristian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like theCatholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?In the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone whocalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify hisactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christiansare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely ifthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't bemuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he havemade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefsaren't a perversion of what your God intended?If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then whyshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?Sorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murderedothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him aChristian."Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense."That does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently muchharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicornsdon't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default thanit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, "weak" atheistswould argue that asserting nothing is better still."Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?"Unfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how "correct"it is, or whether it "works"; consider how many people believe in astrology,graphology, and other pseudo-sciences.Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe ingods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows thepeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.Of course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even whenthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have startedas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves otherpurposes as well."But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say something?"Not really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it'sworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort ofconcept of God in the Christian sense.Of course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it'srather odd to use one religion to try and justify another."What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded that God exists?"For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one whodoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief isnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important torealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in thesame way that theists view their religious leaders.A famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, butwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Manyrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking onsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise."So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothing?"Not entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question hasproperties which have helped it so spread so far.The theory of memetics talks of "memes" -- sets of ideas which can propagatethemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists viewreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread byencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction bydiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressureto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Somereligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled byother memes.Of course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated withsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because ofthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thingbecause of the number of people who have caught it."Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?"There are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just afew of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in somereligions.   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to   find it.   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.   Make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.   It's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change   yourself.   Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.   If you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.   Don't believe things just because you want them to be true.   All beliefs should be open to question.Thanks for taking the time to read this article.mathew-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----iQCVAgUBK8AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY4g7ge8Mo5wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO7ltVtMVTu66Nz6sBbPw9QkbjArbY/S2sZ9NF5htdii0R6SsEyPl0R6/9bV9okE/qnihqnzXE8pGvLt7tlez4EoeHZjXLEFrdEyPVayT54yQqGb4HARbOEHDcrTe2atmPq0Z4hSSPpAU==q2V5-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----For information about PGP 2.2, send mail to pgpinfo@mantis.co.uk.√ø-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----                          An Introduction to Atheism                       by mathew <mathew@mantis.co.uk>This article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism.

Iwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; somerelevant books are listed in a companion article.To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this articleas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All thequestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been croppedup repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.

However, it is sufficiently differentthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind ofGod are not really applicable."But what if God is essentially non-detectable?"If God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interactionmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must bedetectable.If God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that hedoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would arguethat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of noimportance whether he exists or not.If the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.Surely he should still be detectable today?Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientificallyverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive someeffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish himfrom all the other things that don't exist?"OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but isn't it still a religious belief?"One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is "thePerson A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points outthat it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in thestatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  Hethen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed toit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an "agreed fact", butuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscureredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seento be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.The point of this digression is that the answer to the question "Isn'tatheism a religious belief?" depends crucially upon what is meant by"religious".  "Religion" is generally characterized by belief in a superhumancontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith andworship.[ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not  "religion" according to such a definition. ]Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is itcategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of"religious" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects ofhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as "religious" as well -- such asscience, politics, and watching TV."OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is still just an act of faith, like religion is?"Firstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something oneactually believes in.Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions tomake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheiststry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject toquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generallyassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These arethe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called"acts of faith", then almost everything we know must be said to be based onacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.Faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.According to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts offaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic asreligious followers when claiming that something is "certain".  This is not ageneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant tostate with certainty that the universe exists.Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.Sceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheismhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, aseven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (orthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist."If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?"It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either "for" or"against", "friend" or "enemy".  The truth is not so clear-cut.Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,it can be said to be "anti-religion".  However, when religious believersspeak of atheists being "anti-religious" they usually mean that the atheistshave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.Most atheists take a "live and let live" attitude.  Unless questioned, theywill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Ofcourse, this may be in part because atheism is not "socially acceptable" inmany countries.A few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to "convert" otherswhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made littleimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.of church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free toworship as they wished.  The institution of "state atheism" came about whenStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches inorder to gain complete power over the population.)Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they seereligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,the government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned thatchurch and state should remain separate."But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state, surely that's the same as state atheism?"The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shallnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, itmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense ofanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious innature.Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  Forexample, religious believers have historically been responsible forencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizationscampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded asreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheistsare quite happy to see them have their say."What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people pray?"Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do thingsthat those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer inschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that theyneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief meansthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will beacceptable to all those present at any public event.Also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonableto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without othermotives."You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't atheists object to the religious charities?"There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists cancontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, forthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary workfor charities founded on a theistic basis.Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about inconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everydaymatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to sayself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular setof religious beliefs.To "weak" atheists, building a hospital to say "I do not believe in God" is arather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say "Today is not mybirthday".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical."You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?"Perhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt toforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those peoplechoose to call themselves atheists.It's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as abacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On theother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to theexpectations of others.On the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion arebacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to goalong with a group rather than act or think independently."How do atheists differ from religious people?"They don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer aVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,they may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (ManyBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copyof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!Whoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists withoutrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour andappearance."Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?"That depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of courseatheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when onetalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable ("right") and unacceptable("wrong") behaviour within society.Humans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they mustco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage mostatheists from "anti-social" or "immoral" behaviour, purely for the purposesof self-preservation.Many atheists behave in a "moral" or "compassionate" way simply because theyfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they carewhat happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.Naturally, there are some people who behave "immorally" and try to useatheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people whobehave "immorally" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,   be honor and glory forever and ever."The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February   th     by Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,Wisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is areligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior   deteriorated after "born again" experiences.  While only  % of respondents   said they had driven intoxicated before being "born again,"   % had done   so after conversion.  Similarly,  % had used illegal drugs before   conversion,  % after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex   before salvation;  % after.                                ["Freethought Today", September     , p.   .]So it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moralbehaviour."Is there such a thing as atheist morality?"If you mean "Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?", then theanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about moralitywhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.If you mean "Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?", then the answeris no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a personwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same "moral rules" as theists,but for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created byhumans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, ratherthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being."Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?"A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over   % of theatheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work forthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatiblewith what they observed around them.Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they areunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent timestudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They havemade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.This decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of thatindividual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choiceof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the onlychoice that person can honestly make."But don't atheists want to believe in God?"Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Manyof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the"Big Brother" figure might be.Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Shouldone believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks ofsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting tobelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief."But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are unwilling in their souls to see!"Many, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explainedabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that Godexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.Of course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming thatall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.Comments such as "Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properly"are likely to be viewed as patronizing.Certainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it isvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they arebeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are notwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate isfutile."Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?"Many atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think givesmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their livescount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on otherpeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life topolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.It is a natural human tendency to look for "meaning" or "purpose" in randomevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that "life" is the sort of thingthat has a "meaning".To put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actuallya sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking "What is themeaning of life?" is as silly as asking "What is the meaning of a cup ofcoffee?".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is."So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?"There are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.Or on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but sowhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, orshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?In the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists areunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely becauseit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and considerthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's justhard luck."Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?"The short answer is "No, do you?"Many atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered manyarguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they havefound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.Thousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof ofthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikelyto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it."So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments apply?"No, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism isthe sceptical "default position" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheismis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefsbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,but to everyone else."What sort of harm?"Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's notjust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;think of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.Imagine how that effort could be better spent.Many theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instancesof ill people being "healed" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicinesprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have diedbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.It is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- andcondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in manythird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather thanallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a differentreligion."Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some sort of excuse."What makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hardconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fightand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REALChristian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like theCatholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?In the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone whocalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify hisactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christiansare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely ifthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't bemuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he havemade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefsaren't a perversion of what your God intended?If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then whyshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?Sorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murderedothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him aChristian."Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense."That does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently muchharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicornsdon't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default thanit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, "weak" atheistswould argue that asserting nothing is better still."Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?"Unfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how "correct"it is, or whether it "works"; consider how many people believe in astrology,graphology, and other pseudo-sciences.Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe ingods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows thepeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.Of course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even whenthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have startedas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves otherpurposes as well."But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say something?"Not really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it'sworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort ofconcept of God in the Christian sense.Of course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it'srather odd to use one religion to try and justify another."What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded that God exists?"For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one whodoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief isnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important torealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in thesame way that theists view their religious leaders.A famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, butwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Manyrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking onsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise."So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothing?"Not entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question hasproperties which have helped it so spread so far.The theory of memetics talks of "memes" -- sets of ideas which can propagatethemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists viewreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread byencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction bydiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressureto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Somereligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled byother memes.Of course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated withsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because ofthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thingbecause of the number of people who have caught it."Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?"There are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just afew of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in somereligions.   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to   find it.   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.   Make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.   It's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change   yourself.   Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.   If you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.   Don't believe things just because you want them to be true.   All beliefs should be open to question.Thanks for taking the time to read this article.mathew-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----iQCVAgUBK AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY g ge Mo wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO ltVtMVTu  Nz sBbPw QkbjArbY/S sZ NF htdii R SsEyPl R / bV okE/qnihqnzXE pGvLt tlez EoeHZjXLEFrdEyPVayT  yQqGb HARbOEHDcrTe atmPq Z hSSPpAU==q V -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----For information about PGP  . , send mail to pgpinfo@mantis.co.uk.√ø-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----                          An Introduction to Atheism                       by mathew <mathew@mantis.co.uk>This article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism.  Whilst Ihave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, youshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  Iwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; somerelevant books are listed in a companion article.To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this articleas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All thequestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been croppedup repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some otherfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questionsposed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflectquestions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christianswho proselytize on alt.atheism.So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such asChristianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divinebeing.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of itmay not."What is atheism?"Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former isoften referred to as the "weak atheist" position, and the latter as "strongatheism".It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  "Weakatheism" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  "Strongatheism" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do notfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are "strong atheists".Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit theiratheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than makingflat-out denials."But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?"Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believeit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent tobelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true ornot.  Which brings us to agnosticism."What is agnosticism then?"The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of theMetaphysical Society in     .  He defined an agnostic as someone whodisclaimed ("strong") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of thingsmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know forsure whether God exists.Words are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming thatyou can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the factthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many peopleuse agnosticism to mean "weak atheism", and use the word "atheism" only whenreferring to "strong atheism".Beware also that because the word "atheist" has so many shades of meaning, itis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say forsure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn'tthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find outabout the universe."So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?"There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why aparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religionsis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible thatsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because theysee no evidence that God exists."But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?"There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it isquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger thanall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objectsobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarlywell-defined is a matter for debate.However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provablyimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence ofGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible toshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.If on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing inquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalidmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thingmight be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search isoften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largestprimes, because we can prove that they don't exist.Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not existunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most ofthe time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusivelyprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot betested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be toprove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes bydefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of Godexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to covervarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst itmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may bepossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religiousbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God describedby any present-day religion exists.In practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is veryclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently differentthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind ofGod are not really applicable."But what if God is essentially non-detectable?"If God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interactionmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must bedetectable.If God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that hedoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would arguethat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of noimportance whether he exists or not.If the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.Surely he should still be detectable today?Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientificallyverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive someeffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish himfrom all the other things that don't exist?"OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but isn't it still a religious belief?"One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is "thePerson A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points outthat it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in thestatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  Hethen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed toit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an "agreed fact", butuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscureredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seento be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.The point of this digression is that the answer to the question "Isn'tatheism a religious belief?" depends crucially upon what is meant by"religious".  "Religion" is generally characterized by belief in a superhumancontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith andworship.[ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not  "religion" according to such a definition. ]Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is itcategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of"religious" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects ofhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as "religious" as well -- such asscience, politics, and watching TV."OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is still just an act of faith, like religion is?"Firstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something oneactually believes in.Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions tomake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheiststry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject toquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generallyassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These arethe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called"acts of faith", then almost everything we know must be said to be based onacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.Faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.According to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts offaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic asreligious followers when claiming that something is "certain".  This is not ageneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant tostate with certainty that the universe exists.Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.Sceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheismhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, aseven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (orthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist."If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?"It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either "for" or"against", "friend" or "enemy".  The truth is not so clear-cut.Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,it can be said to be "anti-religion".  However, when religious believersspeak of atheists being "anti-religious" they usually mean that the atheistshave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.Most atheists take a "live and let live" attitude.  Unless questioned, theywill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Ofcourse, this may be in part because atheism is not "socially acceptable" inmany countries.A few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to "convert" otherswhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made littleimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.of church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free toworship as they wished.  The institution of "state atheism" came about whenStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches inorder to gain complete power over the population.)Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they seereligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,the government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned thatchurch and state should remain separate."But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state, surely that's the same as state atheism?"The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shallnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, itmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense ofanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious innature.Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  Forexample, religious believers have historically been responsible forencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizationscampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded asreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheistsare quite happy to see them have their say."What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people pray?"Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do thingsthat those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer inschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that theyneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief meansthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will beacceptable to all those present at any public event.Also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonableto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without othermotives."You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't atheists object to the religious charities?"There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists cancontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, forthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary workfor charities founded on a theistic basis.Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about inconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everydaymatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to sayself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular setof religious beliefs.To "weak" atheists, building a hospital to say "I do not believe in God" is arather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say "Today is not mybirthday".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical."You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?"Perhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt toforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those peoplechoose to call themselves atheists.It's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as abacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On theother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to theexpectations of others.On the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion arebacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to goalong with a group rather than act or think independently."How do atheists differ from religious people?"They don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer aVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,they may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (ManyBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copyof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!Whoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists withoutrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour andappearance."Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?"That depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of courseatheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when onetalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable ("right") and unacceptable("wrong") behaviour within society.Humans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they mustco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage mostatheists from "anti-social" or "immoral" behaviour, purely for the purposesof self-preservation.Many atheists behave in a "moral" or "compassionate" way simply because theyfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they carewhat happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.Naturally, there are some people who behave "immorally" and try to useatheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people whobehave "immorally" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,   be honor and glory forever and ever."The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February   th     by Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,Wisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is areligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior   deteriorated after "born again" experiences.  While only  % of respondents   said they had driven intoxicated before being "born again,"   % had done   so after conversion.  Similarly,  % had used illegal drugs before   conversion,  % after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex   before salvation;  % after.                                ["Freethought Today", September     , p.   .]So it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moralbehaviour."Is there such a thing as atheist morality?"If you mean "Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?", then theanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about moralitywhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.If you mean "Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?", then the answeris no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a personwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same "moral rules" as theists,but for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created byhumans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, ratherthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being."Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?"A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over   % of theatheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work forthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatiblewith what they observed around them.Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they areunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent timestudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They havemade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.This decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of thatindividual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choiceof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the onlychoice that person can honestly make."But don't atheists want to believe in God?"Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Manyof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the"Big Brother" figure might be.Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Shouldone believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks ofsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting tobelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief."But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are unwilling in their souls to see!"Many, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explainedabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that Godexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.Of course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming thatall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.Comments such as "Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properly"are likely to be viewed as patronizing.Certainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it isvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they arebeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are notwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate isfutile."Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?"Many atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think givesmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their livescount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on otherpeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life topolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.It is a natural human tendency to look for "meaning" or "purpose" in randomevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that "life" is the sort of thingthat has a "meaning".To put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actuallya sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking "What is themeaning of life?" is as silly as asking "What is the meaning of a cup ofcoffee?".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is."So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?"There are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.Or on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but sowhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, orshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?In the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists areunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely becauseit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and considerthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's justhard luck."Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?"The short answer is "No, do you?"Many atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered manyarguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they havefound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.Thousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof ofthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikelyto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it."So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments apply?"No, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism isthe sceptical "default position" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheismis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefsbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,but to everyone else."What sort of harm?"Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's notjust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;think of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.Imagine how that effort could be better spent.Many theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instancesof ill people being "healed" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicinesprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have diedbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.It is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- andcondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in manythird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather thanallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a differentreligion."Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some sort of excuse."What makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hardconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fightand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REALChristian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like theCatholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?In the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone whocalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify hisactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christiansare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely ifthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't bemuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he havemade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefsaren't a perversion of what your God intended?If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then whyshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?Sorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murderedothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him aChristian."Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense."That does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently muchharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicornsdon't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default thanit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, "weak" atheistswould argue that asserting nothing is better still."Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?"Unfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how "correct"it is, or whether it "works"; consider how many people believe in astrology,graphology, and other pseudo-sciences.Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe ingods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows thepeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.Of course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even whenthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have startedas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves otherpurposes as well."But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say something?"Not really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it'sworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort ofconcept of God in the Christian sense.Of course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it'srather odd to use one religion to try and justify another."What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded that God exists?"For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one whodoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief isnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important torealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in thesame way that theists view their religious leaders.A famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, butwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Manyrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking onsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise."So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothing?"Not entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question hasproperties which have helped it so spread so far.The theory of memetics talks of "memes" -- sets of ideas which can propagatethemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists viewreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread byencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction bydiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressureto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Somereligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled byother memes.Of course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated withsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because ofthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thingbecause of the number of people who have caught it."Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?"There are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just afew of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in somereligions.   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to   find it.   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.   Make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.   It's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change   yourself.   Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.   If you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.   Don't believe things just because you want them to be true.   All beliefs should be open to question.Thanks for taking the time to read this article.mathew-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----iQCVAgUBK AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY g ge Mo wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO ltVtMVTu  Nz

introduction to atheism  Whilst Ihave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues youshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint  Iwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions somerelevant books are listed in a companion articleTo provide a sense of cohesion and progression I have presented this articleas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist  All thequestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been croppedup repeatedly on altatheism since the newsgroup was created  Some otherfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion articlePlease note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questionsposed from a Christian viewpoint  This is because the FAQ files reflectquestions which have actually been asked and it is predominantly Christianswho proselytize on altatheismSo when I talk of religion I am talking primarily about religions such asChristianity Judaism and Islam which involve some sort of superhuman divinebeing  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions but some of itmay notWhat is atheismAtheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of GodSome atheists go further and believe that God does not exist  The former isoften referred to as the weak atheist position and the latter as strongatheismIt is important to note the difference between these two positions  Weakatheism is simple scepticism disbelief in the existence of God  Strongatheism is a positive belief that God does not exist  Please do notfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are strong atheistsSome atheists believe in the nonexistence of all Gods others limit theiratheism to specific Gods such as the Christian God rather than makingflatout denialsBut isnt disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesnt existDefinitely not  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believeit to be true  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent tobelieving that it is false one may simply have no idea whether it is true ornot  Which brings us to agnosticismWhat is agnosticism thenThe term agnosticism was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of theMetaphysical Society in       He defined an agnostic as someone whodisclaimed strong atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of thingsmust be some cause unknown and unknowableThus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know forsure whether God existsWords are slippery things and language is inexact  Beware of assuming thatyou can work out someones philosophical point of view simply from the factthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic  For example many peopleuse agnosticism to mean weak atheism and use the word atheism only whenreferring to strong atheismBeware also that because the word atheist has so many shades of meaning itis very difficult to generalize about atheists  About all you can say forsure is that atheists dont believe in God  For example it certainly isntthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find outabout the universeSo what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheismThere are many philosophical justifications for atheism  To find out why aparticular person chooses to be an atheist its best to ask herMany atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religionsis essentially selfcontradictory and that it is logically impossible thatsuch a God could exist  Others are atheists through scepticism because theysee no evidence that God existsBut isnt it impossible to prove the nonexistence of somethingThere are many counterexamples to such a statement  For example it isquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger thanall other prime numbers  Of course this deals with welldefined objectsobeying welldefined rules  Whether Gods or universes are similarlywelldefined is a matter for debateHowever assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provablyimpossible there are still subtle reasons for assuming the nonexistence ofGod  If we assume that something does not exist it is always possible toshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counterexampleIf on the other hand we assume that something does exist and if the thing inquestion is not provably impossible showing that the assumption is invalidmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thingmight be found to show that it isnt there  Such an exhaustive search isoften impractical or impossible  There is no such problem with largestprimes because we can prove that they dont existTherefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not existunless we have evidence that they do  Even theists follow this rule most ofthe time they dont believe in unicorns even though they cant conclusivelyprove that no unicorns exist anywhereTo assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot betested  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be toprove that he doesnt exist anywhere  So the sceptical atheist assumes bydefault that God does not exist since that is an assumption we can testThose who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of Godexists instead they generally restrict their claims so as to covervarieties of God described by followers of various religions  So whilst itmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists it may bepossible to prove that say a God as described by a particular religiousbook does not exist  It may even be possible to prove that no God describedby any presentday religion existsIn practice believing that no God described by any religion exists is veryclose to believing that no God exists  However it is sufficiently differentthat counterarguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind ofGod are not really applicableBut what if God is essentially nondetectableIf God interacts with our universe in any way the effects of his interactionmust be measurable  Hence his interaction with our universe must bedetectableIf God is essentially nondetectable it must therefore be the case that hedoes not interact with our universe in any way  Many atheists would arguethat if God does not interact with our universe at all it is of noimportance whether he exists or notIf the Bible is to be believed God was easily detectable by the IsraelitesSurely he should still be detectable todayNote that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientificallyverifiable physical way  It must surely be possible to perceive someeffect caused by his presence though otherwise how can I distinguish himfrom all the other things that dont existOK you may think theres a philosophical justification for atheism but isnt it still a religious beliefOne of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is thePerson A begins by making a contentious statement  When person B points outthat it cant be true person A gradually redefines the words he used in thestatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept  Hethen records the statement along with the fact that person B has agreed toit and continues  Eventually A uses the statement as an agreed fact butuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscureredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it  Rather than be seento be apparently inconsistent B will tend to play alongThe point of this digression is that the answer to the question Isntatheism a religious belief depends crucially upon what is meant byreligious  Religion is generally characterized by belief in a superhumancontrolling power  especially in some sort of God  and by faith andworship Its worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not  religion according to such a definition Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power nor is itcategorized by worship in any meaningful sense  Widening the definition ofreligious to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects ofhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as religious as well  such asscience politics and watching TVOK so its not a religion  But surely belief in atheism or science is still just an act of faith like religion isFirstly its not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something oneactually believes inSecondly it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions tomake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience  Most atheiststry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible and even those are subject toquestioning if experience throws them into doubtScience has a number of core assumptions  For example it is generallyassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers  These arethe sort of core assumptions atheists make  If such basic ideas are calledacts of faith then almost everything we know must be said to be based onacts of faith and the term loses its meaningFaith is more often used to refer to complete certain belief in somethingAccording to such a definition atheism and science are certainly not acts offaith  Of course individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic asreligious followers when claiming that something is certain  This is not ageneral tendency however there are many atheists who would be reluctant tostate with certainty that the universe existsFaith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proofSceptical atheism certainly doesnt fit that definition as sceptical atheismhas no beliefs  Strong atheism is closer but still doesnt really match aseven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data orthe lack of it when asserting that God does not existIf atheism is not religious surely its antireligiousIt is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either for oragainst friend or enemy  The truth is not so clearcutAtheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism in that senseit can be said to be antireligion  However when religious believersspeak of atheists being antireligious they usually mean that the atheistshave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theistsThis categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfairAtheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrumMost atheists take a live and let live attitude  Unless questioned theywill not usually mention their atheism except perhaps to close friends  Ofcourse this may be in part because atheism is not socially acceptable inmany countriesA few atheists are quite antireligious and may even try to convert otherswhen possible  Historically such antireligious atheists have made littleimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countriesof church and state just like the USA  Soviet citizens were legally free toworship as they

spent timestudying one or more religions sometimes in very great depth  They havemade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefsThis decision may of course be an inevitable consequence of thatindividuals personality  For a naturally sceptical person the choiceof atheism is often the only one that makes sense and hence the onlychoice that person can honestly makeBut dont atheists want to believe in GodAtheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them  Manyof them have no desire to be watched over no matter how goodnatured theBig Brother figure might beSome atheists would like to be able to believe in God  but so what Shouldone believe things merely because one wants them to be true  The risks ofsuch an approach should be obvious  Atheists often decide that wanting tobelieve something is not enough there must be evidence for the beliefBut of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God  they are unwilling in their souls to seeMany if not most atheists were previously religious  As has been explainedabove the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that Godexists  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach GodOf course it is true that some atheists lack an open mind but assuming thatall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closedmindedComments such as Of course God is there you just arent looking properlyare likely to be viewed as patronizingCertainly if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it isvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they arebeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God  If you are notwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth debate isfutileIsnt the whole of life completely pointless to an atheistMany atheists live a purposeful life  They decide what they think givesmeaning to life and they pursue those goals  They try to make their livescount not by wishing for eternal life but by having an influence on otherpeople who will live on  For example an atheist may dedicate his life topolitical reform in the hope of leaving his mark on historyIt is a natural human tendency to look for meaning or purpose in randomevents  However it is by no means obvious that life is the sort of thingthat has a meaningTo put it another way not everything which looks like a question is actuallya sensible thing to ask  Some atheists believe that asking What is themeaning of life is as silly as asking What is the meaning of a cup ofcoffee  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning it just isSo how do atheists find comfort in time of dangerThere are many ways of obtaining comfort from family friends or even petsOr on a less spiritual level from food or drink or TVThat may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger but sowhat  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting orshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might beIn the end its a decision for the individual concerned  Most atheists areunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely becauseit makes them feel comfortable  They put truth before comfort and considerthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy thats justhard luckDont atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrongThe short answer is No do youMany atheists have been atheists for years  They have encountered manyarguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God but they havefound all of it to be invalid or inconclusiveThousands of years of religious belief havent resulted in any good proof ofthe existence of God  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikelyto be proved wrong in the immediate future and they stop worrying about itSo why should theists question their beliefs Dont the same arguments applyNo because the beliefs being questioned are not similar  Weak atheism isthe sceptical default position to take it asserts nothing  Strong atheismis a negative belief  Theism is a very strong positive beliefAtheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefsbecause of the very real harm they can cause  not just to the believersbut to everyone elseWhat sort of harmReligion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind  Its notjust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildingsthink of all the time and effort spent building churches praying and so onImagine how that effort could be better spentMany theists believe in miracle healing  There have been plenty of instancesof ill people being healed by a priest ceasing to take the medicinesprescribed to them by doctors and dying as a result  Some theists have diedbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious groundsIt is arguable that the Catholic Churchs opposition to birth control  andcondoms in particular  is increasing the problem of overpopulation in manythirdworld countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS worldwideReligious believers have been known to murder their children rather thanallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a differentreligionThose werent REAL believers  They just claimed to be believers as some sort of excuseWhat makes a real believer  There are so many One True Religions its hardconvinced that they are the only true Christians  Sometimes they even fightand kill each other  How is an atheist supposed to decide whos a REALChristian and who isnt when even the major Christian churches like theCatholic Church and the Church of England cant decide amongst themselvesIn the end most atheists take a pragmatic view and decide that anyone whocalls himself a Christian and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify hisactions should be considered a Christian  Maybe some of those Christiansare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends  but surely ifthe Bible can be so readily used to support unChristian acts it cant bemuch of a moral code If the Bible is the word of God why couldnt he havemade it less easy to misinterpret And how do you know that your beliefsarent a perversion of what your God intendedIf there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible then whyshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your saysoSorry but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murderedothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so we must call him aChristianObviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned  But since nobody has ever proved that God does not exist it must be very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs shared by all faiths are nonsenseThat does not hold because as was pointed out at the start of this dialoguepositive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently muchharder to disprove than negative ones  Nobody has ever proved that unicornsdont exist but that doesnt make it unlikely that they are mythsIt is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default thanit is to hold a positive assertion by default  Of course weak atheistswould argue that asserting nothing is better stillWell if atheisms so great why are there so many theistsUnfortunately the popularity of a belief has little to do with how correctit is or whether it works consider how many people believe in astrologygraphology and other pseudosciencesMany atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe ingods  Certainly in many primitive human societies religion allows thepeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understandOf course theres more to religion than that  In the industrialized worldwe find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even whenthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations  Religion may have startedas a means of attempting to explain the world but nowadays it serves otherpurposes as wellBut so many cultures have developed religions  Surely that must say somethingNot really  Most religions are only superficially similar for example itsworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort ofconcept of God in the Christian senseOf course most religions are quick to denounce competing religions so itsrather odd to use one religion to try and justify anotherWhat about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded that God existsFor every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god there is one whodoes not  Besides as has already been pointed out the truth of a belief isnot determined by how many people believe it  Also it is important torealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in thesame way that theists view their religious leadersA famous scientist is only human she may be an expert in some fields butwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight  Manyrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking onsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertiseSo are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothingNot entirely  It certainly indicates that the religion in question hasproperties which have helped it so spread so farThe theory of memetics talks of memes  sets of ideas which can propagatethemselves between human minds by analogy with genes  Some atheists viewreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes which spread byencouraging their hosts to convert others  Some memes avoid destruction bydiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine or by using peer pressureto keep onetime believers from admitting that they were mistaken  Somereligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled byother memesOf course in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated withsuccessful propagation of a meme  Religion is not a good thing because ofthe number of people who believe it any more than a disease is a good thingbecause of the number of people who have caught itEven if religion is not entirely true at least it puts across important messages  What are the fundamental messages of atheismThere are many important ideas atheists promote  The following are just afew of them dont be surprised to see ideas which are also present in somereligions   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules   Be especially sceptical of positive claims   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning its up to you to   find it   Search for what is true even if it makes you uncomfortable   Make the most of your life as its probably the only one youll have   Its no good relying on some external power to change you you must change   yourself   Just because somethings popular doesnt mean its good   If you must assume something assume something its easy to test   Dont believe things just because you want them to be true   All beliefs should be open to questionThanks for taking the time to read this articlemathewBEGIN PGP SIGNATUREiQCVAgUBK AjRXzXNVrOblFAQFSbwPMHePY g ge Mo wpsivXkHYYxMErFAO ltVtMVTu  Nz sBbPw QkbjArbYS sZ NF htdii R

begin pgp signed message an introduction to atheism by mathew mathewmantiscoukthis article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism whilst ihave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues youshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint iwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions somerelevant books are listed in a companion articleto provide a sense of cohesion and progression i have presented this articleas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist all thequestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been croppedup repeatedly on altatheism since the newsgroup was created some otherfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion articleplease note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questionsposed from a christian viewpoint this is because the faq files reflectquestions which have actually been asked and it is predominantly christianswho proselytize on altatheismso when i talk of religion i am talking primarily about religions such aschristianity judaism and islam which involve some sort of superhuman divinebeing much of the discussion will apply to other religions but some of itmay notwhat is atheismatheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of godsome atheists go further and believe that god does not exist the former isoften referred to as the weak atheist position and the latter as strongatheismit is important to note the difference between these two positions weakatheism is simple scepticism disbelief in the existence of god strongatheism is a positive belief that god does not exist please do notfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are strong atheistssome atheists believe in the nonexistence of all gods others limit theiratheism to specific gods such as the christian god rather than makingflatout denialsbut isnt disbelieving in god the same thing as believing he doesnt existdefinitely not disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believeit to be true not believing that something is true is not equivalent tobelieving that it is false one may simply have no idea whether it is true ornot which brings us to agnosticismwhat is agnosticism thenthe term agnosticism was coined by professor huxley at a meeting of themetaphysical society in he defined an agnostic as someone whodisclaimed strong atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of thingsmust be some cause unknown and unknowablethus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know forsure whether god existswords are slippery things and language is inexact beware of assuming thatyou can work out someones philosophical point of view simply from the factthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic for example many peopleuse agnosticism to mean weak atheism and use the word atheism only whenreferring to strong atheismbeware also that because the word atheist has so many shades of meaning itis very difficult to generalize about atheists about all you can say forsure is that atheists dont believe in god for example it certainly isntthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find outabout the universeso what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheismthere are many philosophical justifications for atheism to find out why

othermotivesyou mentioned christians who campaign for increased foreign aid what about atheists why arent there any atheist charities or hospitals dont atheists object to the religious charitiesthere are many charities without religious purpose that atheists cancontribute to some atheists contribute to religious charities as well forthe sake of the practical good they do some atheists even do voluntary workfor charities founded on a theistic basismost atheists seem to feel that atheism isnt worth shouting about inconnection with charity to them atheism is just a simple obvious everydaymatter and so is charity many feel that its somewhat cheap not to sayselfrighteous to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular setof religious beliefsto weak atheists building a hospital to say i do not believe in god is arather strange idea its rather like holding a party to say today is not mybirthday why the fuss atheism is rarely evangelicalyou said atheism isnt antireligious but is it perhaps a backlash against ones upbringing a way of rebellingperhaps it is for some but many people have parents who do not attempt toforce any religious or atheist ideas upon them and many of those peoplechoose to call themselves atheistsits also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as abacklash against an atheist upbringing as a way of being different on theother hand many people choose religion as a way of conforming to theexpectations of otherson the whole we cant conclude much about whether atheism or religion arebacklash or conformism although in general people have a tendency to goalong with a group rather than act or think independentlyhow do atheists differ from religious peoplethey dont believe in god thats all there is to itatheists may listen to heavy metal backwards even or they may prefer averdi requiem even if they know the words they may wear hawaiian shirtsthey may dress all in black they may even wear orange robes manybuddhists lack a belief in any sort of god some atheists even carry a copyof the bible around for arguing against of coursewhoever you are the chances are you have met several atheists withoutrealising it atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour andappearanceunexceptional but arent atheists less moral than religious peoplethat depends if you define morality as obedience to god then of courseatheists are less moral as they dont obey any god but usually when onetalks of morality one talks of what is acceptable right and unacceptablewrong behaviour within societyhumans are social animals and to be maximally successful they mustcooperate with each other this is a good enough reason to discourage mostatheists from antisocial or immoral behaviour purely for the purposesof selfpreservationmany atheists behave in a moral or compassionate way simply because theyfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans so why do they carewhat happens to others they dont know they simply are that waynaturally there are some people who behave immorally and try to useatheism to justify their actions however there are equally many people whobehave immorally and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their came into the world to save sinners but for that very reason i was shown mercy so that in me jesus christ might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life now to the king eternal immortal invisible the only god be honor and glory forever and everthe above quote is from a statement made to the court on february th by jeffrey dahmer the notorious cannibal serial killer of milwaukeewisconsin it seems that for every atheist massmurderer there is areligious massmurderer but what of more trivial morality a survey conducted by the roper organization found that behavior deteriorated after born again experiences while only of respondents said they had driven intoxicated before being born again had done so after conversion similarly had used illegal drugs before conversion after two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex before salvation after freethought today september p so it seems that at best religion does not have a monopoly on moralbehaviouris there such a thing as atheist moralityif you mean is there such a thing as morality for atheists then theanswer is yes as explained above many atheists have ideas about moralitywhich are at least as strong as those held by religious peopleif you mean does atheism have a characteristic moral code then the answeris no atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a personwill behave most atheists follow many of the same moral rules as theistsbut for different reasons atheists view morality as something created byhumans according to the way humans feel the world ought to work ratherthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural beingthen arent atheists just theists who are denying goda study by the freedom from religion foundation found that over of theatheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work forthem they had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatiblewith what they observed around thematheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial they areunbelievers through choice the vast majority of them have spent timestudying one or more religions sometimes in very great depth they havemade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefsthis decision may of course be an inevitable consequence of thatindividuals personality for a naturally sceptical person the choiceof atheism is often the only one that makes sense and hence the onlychoice that person can honestly makebut dont atheists want to believe in godatheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them manyof them have no desire to be watched over no matter how goodnatured thebig brother figure might besome atheists would like to be able to believe in god but so what shouldone believe things merely because one wants them to be true the risks ofsuch an approach should be obvious atheists often decide that wanting tobelieve something is not enough there must be evidence for the beliefbut of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of god they are unwilling in their souls to seemany if not most atheists were previously religious as has been explainedabove the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that godexists many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach godof course it is true that some atheists lack an open mind but assuming thatall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closedmindedcomments such as of course god is there you just arent looking properlyare likely to be viewed as patronizingcertainly if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it isvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they arebeing sincere if they say that they have searched for god if you are notwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth debate isfutileisnt the whole of life completely pointless to an atheistmany atheists live a purposeful life they decide what they think givesmeaning to life and they pursue those goals they try to make their livescount not by wishing for eternal life but by having an influence on otherpeople who will live on for example an atheist may dedicate his life topolitical reform in the hope of leaving his mark on historyit is a natural human tendency to look for meaning or purpose in randomevents however it is by no means obvious that life is the sort of thingthat has a meaningto put it another way not everything which looks like a question is actuallya sensible thing to ask some atheists believe that asking what is themeaning of life is as silly as asking what is the meaning of a cup ofcoffee they believe that life has no purpose or meaning it just isso how do atheists find comfort in time of dangerthere are many ways of obtaining comfort from family friends or even petsor on a less spiritual level from food or drink or tvthat may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger but sowhat should individuals believe in things because they are comforting orshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might bein the end its a decision for the individual concerned most atheists areunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely becauseit makes them feel comfortable they put truth before comfort and considerthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy thats justhard luckdont atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrongthe short answer is no do youmany atheists have been atheists for years they have encountered manyarguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of god but they havefound all of it to be invalid or inconclusivethousands of years of religious belief havent resulted in any good proof ofthe existence of god atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikelyto be proved wrong in the immediate future and they stop worrying about itso why should theists question their beliefs dont the same arguments applyno because the beliefs being questioned are not similar weak atheism isthe sceptical default position to take it asserts nothing strong atheismis a negative belief theism is a very strong positive beliefatheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefsbecause of the very real harm they can cause not just to the believersbut to everyone elsewhat sort of harmreligion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind its notjust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildingsthink of all the time and effort spent building churches praying and so onimagine how that effort could be better spentmany theists believe in miracle healing there have been plenty of instancesof ill people being healed by a priest ceasing to take the medicinesprescribed to them by doctors and dying as a result some theists have diedbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious groundsit is arguable that the catholic churchs opposition to birth control andcondoms in particular is increasing the problem of overpopulation in manythirdworld countries and contributing to the spread of aids worldwidereligious believers have been known to murder their children rather thanallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a differentreligionthose werent real believers they just claimed to be believers as some sort of excusewhat makes a real believer there are so many one true religions its hardconvinced that they are the only true christians sometimes they even fightand kill each other how is an atheist supposed to decide whos a realchristian and who isnt when even the major christian churches like thecatholic church and the church of england cant decide amongst themselvesin the end most atheists take a pragmatic view and decide that anyone whocalls himself a christian and uses christian belief or dogma to justify hisactions should be considered a christian maybe some of those christiansare just perverting christian teaching for their own ends but surely ifthe bible can be so readily used to support unchristian acts it cant bemuch of a moral code if the bible is the word of god why couldnt he havemade it less easy to misinterpret and how do you know that your beliefsarent a perversion of what your god intendedif there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the bible then whyshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your saysosorry but if someone claims that he believes in jesus and that he murderedothers because jesus and the bible told him to do so we must call him achristianobviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned but since nobody has ever proved that god does not exist it must be very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs shared by all faiths are nonsensethat does not hold because as was pointed out at the start of this dialoguepositive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently muchharder to disprove than negative ones nobody has ever proved that unicornsdont exist but that doesnt make it unlikely that they are mythsit is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default thanit is to hold a positive assertion by default of course weak atheistswould argue that asserting nothing is better stillwell if atheisms so great why are there so many theistsunfortunately the popularity of a belief has little to do with how correctit is or whether it works consider how many people believe in astrologygraphology and other pseudosciencesmany atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe ingods certainly in many primitive human societies religion allows thepeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understandof course theres more to religion than that in the industrialized worldwe find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even whenthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations religion may have startedas a means of attempting to explain the world but nowadays it serves otherpurposes as wellbut so many cultures have developed religions surely that must say somethingnot really most religions are only superficially similar for example itsworth remembering that religions such as buddhism and taoism lack any sort ofconcept of god in the christian senseof course most religions are quick to denounce competing religions so itsrather odd to use one religion to try and justify anotherwhat about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded that god existsfor every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god there is one whodoes not besides as has already been pointed out the truth of a belief isnot determined by how many people believe it also it is important torealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in thesame way that theists view their religious leadersa famous scientist is only human she may be an expert in some fields butwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight manyrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking onsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertiseso are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothingnot entirely it certainly indicates that the religion in question hasproperties which have helped it so spread so farthe theory of memetics talks of memes sets of ideas which can propagatethemselves between human minds by analogy with genes some atheists viewreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes which spread byencouraging their hosts to convert others some memes avoid destruction bydiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine or by using peer pressureto keep onetime believers from admitting that they were mistaken somereligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled byother memesof course in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated withsuccessful propagation of a meme religion is not a good thing because ofthe number of people who believe it any more than a disease is a good thingbecause of the number of people who have caught iteven if religion is not entirely true at least it puts across important messages what are the fundamental messages of atheismthere are many important ideas atheists promote the following are just afew of them dont be surprised to see ideas which are also present in somereligions there is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules be especially sceptical of positive claims if you want your life to have some sort of meaning its up to you to find it search for what is true even if it makes you uncomfortable make the most of your life as its probably the only one youll have its no good relying on some external power to change you you must change yourself just because somethings popular doesnt mean its good if you must assume something assume something its easy to test dont believe things just because you want them to be true all beliefs should be open to questionthanks for taking

Introduction to Atheism                       by mathew <mathew@mantis.co.uk>This article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism.  Whilst Ihave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, youshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  Iwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; somerelevant books are listed in a companion article.To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this articleas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All thequestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been croppedup repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some otherfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questionsposed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflectquestions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christianswho proselytize on alt.atheism.So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such asChristianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divinebeing.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of itmay not."What is atheism?"Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former isoften referred to as the "weak atheist" position, and the latter as "strongatheism".It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  "Weakatheism" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  "Strongatheism" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do notfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are "strong atheists".Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit theiratheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than makingflat-out denials."But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?"Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believeit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent tobelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true ornot.  Which brings us to agnosticism."What is agnosticism then?"The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of theMetaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone whodisclaimed ("strong") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of thingsmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know forsure whether God exists.Words are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming thatyou can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the factthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many peopleuse agnosticism to mean "weak atheism", and use the word "atheism" only whenreferring to "strong atheism".Beware also that because the word "atheist" has so many shades of meaning, itis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say forsure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn'tthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find outabout the universe."So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?"There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why aparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religionsis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible thatsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because theysee no evidence that God exists."But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?"There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it isquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger thanall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objectsobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarlywell-defined is a matter for debate.However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provablyimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence ofGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible toshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.If on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing inquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalidmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thingmight be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search isoften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largestprimes, because we can prove that they don't exist.Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not existunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most ofthe time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusivelyprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot betested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be toprove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes bydefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of Godexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to covervarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst itmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may bepossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religiousbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God describedby any present-day religion exists.In practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is veryclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently differentthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind ofGod are not really applicable."But what if God is essentially non-detectable?"If God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interactionmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must bedetectable.If God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that hedoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would arguethat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of noimportance whether he exists or not.If the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.Surely he should still be detectable today?Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientificallyverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive someeffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish himfrom all the other things that don't exist?"OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but isn't it still a religious belief?"One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is "thePerson A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points outthat it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in thestatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  Hethen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed toit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an "agreed fact", butuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscureredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seento be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.The point of this digression is that the answer to the question "Isn'tatheism a religious belief?" depends crucially upon what is meant by"religious".  "Religion" is generally characterized by belief in a superhumancontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith andworship.[ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not  "religion" according to such a definition. ]Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is itcategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of"religious" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects ofhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as "religious" as well -- such asscience, politics, and watching TV."OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is still just an act of faith, like religion is?"Firstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something oneactually believes in.Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions tomake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheiststry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject toquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generallyassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These arethe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called"acts of faith", then almost everything we know must be said to be based onacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.Faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.According to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts offaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic asreligious followers when claiming that something is "certain".  This is not ageneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant tostate with certainty that the universe exists.Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.Sceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheismhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, aseven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (orthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist."If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?"It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either "for" or"against", "friend" or "enemy".  The truth is not so clear-cut.Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,it can be said to be "anti-religion".  However, when religious believersspeak of atheists being "anti-religious" they usually mean that the atheistshave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.Most atheists take a "live and let live" attitude.  Unless questioned, theywill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Ofcourse, this may be in part because atheism is not "socially acceptable" inmany countries.A few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to "convert" otherswhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made littleimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.of church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free toworship as they wished.  The institution of "state atheism" came about whenStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches inorder to gain complete power over the population.)Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they seereligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,the government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned thatchurch and state should remain separate."But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state, surely that's the same as state atheism?"The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shallnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, itmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense ofanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious innature.Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  Forexample, religious believers have historically been responsible forencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizationscampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded asreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheistsare quite happy to see them have their say."What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people pray?"Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do thingsthat those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer inschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that theyneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief meansthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will beacceptable to all those present at any public event.Also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonableto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without othermotives."You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't atheists object to the religious charities?"There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists cancontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, forthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary workfor charities founded on a theistic basis.Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about inconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everydaymatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to sayself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular setof religious beliefs.To "weak" atheists, building a hospital to say "I do not believe in God" is arather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say "Today is not mybirthday".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical."You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?"Perhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt toforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those peoplechoose to call themselves atheists.It's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as abacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On theother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to theexpectations of others.On the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion arebacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to goalong with a group rather than act or think independently."How do atheists differ from religious people?"They don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer aVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,they may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (ManyBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copyof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!Whoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists withoutrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour andappearance."Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?"That depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of courseatheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when onetalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable ("right") and unacceptable("wrong") behaviour within society.Humans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they mustco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage mostatheists from "anti-social" or "immoral" behaviour, purely for the purposesof self-preservation.Many atheists behave in a "moral" or "compassionate" way simply because theyfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they carewhat happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.Naturally, there are some people who behave "immorally" and try to useatheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people whobehave "immorally" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,   be honor and glory forever and ever."The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992by Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,Wisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is areligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior   deteriorated after "born again" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents   said they had driven intoxicated before being "born again," 12% had done   so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before   conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex   before salvation; 5% after.                                ["Freethought Today", September 1991, p. 12.]So it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moralbehaviour."Is there such a thing as atheist morality?"If you mean "Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?", then theanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about moralitywhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.If you mean "Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?", then the answeris no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a personwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same "moral rules" as theists,but for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created byhumans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, ratherthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being."Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?"A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of theatheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work forthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatiblewith what they observed around them.Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they areunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent timestudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They havemade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.This decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of thatindividual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choiceof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the onlychoice that person can honestly make."But don't atheists want to believe in God?"Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Manyof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the"Big Brother" figure might be.Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Shouldone believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks ofsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting tobelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief."But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are unwilling in their souls to see!"Many, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explainedabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that Godexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.Of course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming thatall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.Comments such as "Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properly"are likely to be viewed as patronizing.Certainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it isvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they arebeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are notwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate isfutile."Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?"Many atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think givesmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their livescount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on otherpeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life topolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.It is a natural human tendency to look for "meaning" or "purpose" in randomevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that "life" is the sort of thingthat has a "meaning".To put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actuallya sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking "What is themeaning of life?" is as silly as asking "What is the meaning of a cup ofcoffee?".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is."So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?"There are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.Or on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but sowhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, orshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?In the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists areunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely becauseit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and considerthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's justhard luck."Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?"The short answer is "No, do you?"Many atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered manyarguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they havefound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.Thousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof ofthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikelyto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it."So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments apply?"No, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism isthe sceptical "default position" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheismis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefsbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,but to everyone else."What sort of harm?"Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's notjust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;think of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.Imagine how that effort could be better spent.Many theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instancesof ill people being "healed" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicinesprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have diedbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.It is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- andcondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in manythird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather thanallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a differentreligion."Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some sort of excuse."What makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hardconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fightand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REALChristian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like theCatholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?In the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone whocalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify hisactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christiansare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely ifthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't bemuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he havemade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefsaren't a perversion of what your God intended?If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then whyshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?Sorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murderedothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him aChristian."Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense."That does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently muchharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicornsdon't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default thanit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, "weak" atheistswould argue that asserting nothing is better still."Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?"Unfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how "correct"it is, or whether it "works"; consider how many people believe in astrology,graphology, and other pseudo-sciences.Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe ingods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows thepeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.Of course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even whenthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have startedas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves otherpurposes as well."But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say something?"Not really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it'sworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort ofconcept of God in the Christian sense.Of course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it'srather odd to use one religion to try and justify another."What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded that God exists?"For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one whodoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief isnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important torealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in thesame way that theists view their religious leaders.A famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, butwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Manyrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking onsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise."So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothing?"Not entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question hasproperties which have helped it so spread so far.The theory of memetics talks of "memes" -- sets of ideas which can propagatethemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists viewreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread byencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction bydiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressureto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Somereligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled byother memes.Of course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated withsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because ofthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thingbecause of the number of people who have caught it."Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?"There are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just afew of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in somereligions.   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to   find it.   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.   Make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.   It's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change   yourself.   Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.   If you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.   Don't believe things just because you want them to be true.   All beliefs should be open to question.Thanks for taking the time to read this article.mathew-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----iQCVAgUBK8AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY4g7ge8Mo5wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO7ltVtMVTu66Nz6sBbPw9QkbjArbY/S2sZ9NF5htdii0R6SsEyPl0R6/9bV9okE/qnihqnzXE8pGvLt7tlez4EoeHZjXLEFrdEyPVayT54yQqGb4HARbOEHDcrTe2atmPq0Z4hSSPpAU==q2V5-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----For information about PGP 2.2, send mail to pgpinfo@mantis.co.uk.√ø-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----                          An Introduction to Atheism                       by mathew <mathew@mantis.co.uk>This article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism.  Whilst Ihave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, youshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  Iwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; somerelevant books are listed in a companion article.To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this articleas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All thequestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been croppedup repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some otherfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questionsposed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflectquestions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christianswho proselytize on alt.atheism.So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such asChristianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divinebeing.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of itmay not."What is atheism?"Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former isoften referred to as the "weak atheist" position, and the latter as "strongatheism".It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  "Weakatheism" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  "Strongatheism" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do notfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are "strong atheists".Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit theiratheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than makingflat-out denials."But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?"Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believeit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent tobelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true ornot.  Which brings us to agnosticism."What is agnosticism then?"The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of theMetaphysical Society in     .  He defined an agnostic as someone whodisclaimed ("strong") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of thingsmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know forsure whether God exists.Words are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming thatyou can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the factthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many peopleuse agnosticism to mean "weak atheism", and use the word "atheism" only whenreferring to "strong atheism".Beware also that because the word "atheist" has so many shades of meaning, itis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say forsure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn'tthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find outabout the universe."So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?"There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why aparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religionsis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible thatsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because theysee no evidence that God exists."But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?"There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it isquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger thanall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objectsobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarlywell-defined is a matter for debate.However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provablyimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence ofGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible toshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.If on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing inquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalidmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thingmight be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search isoften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largestprimes, because we can prove that they don't exist.Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not existunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most ofthe time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusivelyprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot betested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be toprove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes bydefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of Godexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to covervarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst itmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may bepossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religiousbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God describedby any present-day religion exists.In practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is veryclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently differentthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind ofGod are not really applicable."But what if God is essentially non-detectable?"If God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interactionmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must bedetectable.If God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that hedoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would arguethat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of noimportance whether he exists or not.If the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.Surely he should still be detectable today?Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientificallyverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive someeffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish himfrom all the other things that don't exist?"OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but isn't it still a religious belief?"One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is "thePerson A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points outthat it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in thestatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  Hethen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed toit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an "agreed fact", butuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscureredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seento be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.The point of this digression is that the answer to the question "Isn'tatheism a religious belief?" depends crucially upon what is meant by"religious".  "Religion" is generally characterized by belief in a superhumancontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith andworship.[ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not  "religion" according to such a definition. ]Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is itcategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of"religious" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects ofhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as "religious" as well -- such asscience, politics, and watching TV."OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is still just an act of faith, like religion is?"Firstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something oneactually believes in.Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions tomake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheiststry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject toquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generallyassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These arethe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called"acts of faith", then almost everything we know must be said to be based onacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.Faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.According to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts offaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic asreligious followers when claiming that something is "certain".  This is not ageneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant tostate with certainty that the universe exists.Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.Sceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheismhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, aseven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (orthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist."If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?"It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either "for" or"against", "friend" or "enemy".  The truth is not so clear-cut.Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,it can be said to be "anti-religion".  However, when religious believersspeak of atheists being "anti-religious" they usually mean that the atheistshave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.Most atheists take a "live and let live" attitude.  Unless questioned, theywill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Ofcourse, this may be in part because atheism is not "socially acceptable" inmany countries.A few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to "convert" otherswhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made littleimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.of church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free toworship as they wished.  The institution of "state atheism" came about whenStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches inorder to gain complete power over the population.)Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they seereligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,the government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned thatchurch and state should remain separate."But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state, surely that's the same as state atheism?"The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shallnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, itmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense ofanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious innature.Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  Forexample, religious believers have historically been responsible forencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizationscampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded asreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheistsare quite happy to see them have their say."What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people pray?"Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do thingsthat those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer inschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that theyneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief meansthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will beacceptable to all those present at any public event.Also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonableto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without othermotives."You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't atheists object to the religious charities?"There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists cancontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, forthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary workfor charities founded on a theistic basis.Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about inconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everydaymatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to sayself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular setof religious beliefs.To "weak" atheists, building a hospital to say "I do not believe in God" is arather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say "Today is not mybirthday".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical."You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?"Perhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt toforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those peoplechoose to call themselves atheists.It's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as abacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On theother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to theexpectations of others.On the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion arebacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to goalong with a group rather than act or think independently."How do atheists differ from religious people?"They don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer aVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,they may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (ManyBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copyof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!Whoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists withoutrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour andappearance."Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?"That depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of courseatheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when onetalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable ("right") and unacceptable("wrong") behaviour within society.Humans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they mustco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage mostatheists from "anti-social" or "immoral" behaviour, purely for the purposesof self-preservation.Many atheists behave in a "moral" or "compassionate" way simply because theyfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they carewhat happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.Naturally, there are some people who behave "immorally" and try to useatheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people whobehave "immorally" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive   eternal life.

Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex   before salvation;  % after.                                ["Freethought Today", September     , p.   .]So it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moralbehaviour."Is there such a thing as atheist morality?"If you mean "Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?", then theanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about moralitywhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.If you mean "Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?", then the answeris no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a personwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same "moral rules" as theists,but for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created byhumans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, ratherthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being."Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?"A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over   % of theatheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work forthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatiblewith what they observed around them.Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they areunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent timestudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They havemade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.This decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of thatindividual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choiceof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the onlychoice that person can honestly make."But don't atheists want to believe in God?"Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Manyof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the"Big Brother" figure might be.Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Shouldone believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks ofsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting tobelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief."But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are unwilling in their souls to see!"Many, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explainedabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that Godexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.Of course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming thatall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.Comments such as "Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properly"are likely to be viewed as patronizing.Certainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it isvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they arebeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are notwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate isfutile."Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?"Many atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think givesmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their livescount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on otherpeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life topolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.It is a natural human tendency to look for "meaning" or "purpose" in randomevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that "life" is the sort of thingthat has a "meaning".To put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actuallya sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking "What is themeaning of life?" is as silly as asking "What is the meaning of a cup ofcoffee?".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is."So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?"There are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.Or on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but sowhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, orshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?In the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists areunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely becauseit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and considerthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's justhard luck."Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?"The short answer is "No, do you?"Many atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered manyarguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they havefound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.Thousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof ofthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikelyto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it."So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments apply?"No, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism isthe sceptical "default position" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheismis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefsbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,but to everyone else."What sort of harm?"Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's notjust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;think of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.Imagine how that effort could be better spent.Many theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instancesof ill people being "healed" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicinesprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have diedbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.It is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- andcondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in manythird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather thanallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a differentreligion."Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some sort of excuse."What makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hardconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fightand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REALChristian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like theCatholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?In the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone whocalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify hisactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christiansare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely ifthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't bemuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he havemade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefsaren't a perversion of what your God intended?If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then whyshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?Sorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murderedothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him aChristian."Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense."That does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently muchharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicornsdon't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default thanit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, "weak" atheistswould argue that asserting nothing is better still."Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?"Unfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how "correct"it is, or whether it "works"; consider how many people believe in astrology,graphology, and other pseudo-sciences.Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe ingods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows thepeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.Of course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even whenthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have startedas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves otherpurposes as well."But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say something?"Not really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it'sworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort ofconcept of God in the Christian sense.Of course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it'srather odd to use one religion to try and justify another."What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded that God exists?"For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one whodoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief isnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important torealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in thesame way that theists view their religious leaders.A famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, butwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Manyrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking onsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise."So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothing?"Not entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question hasproperties which have helped it so spread so far.The theory of memetics talks of "memes" -- sets of ideas which can propagatethemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists viewreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread byencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction bydiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressureto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Somereligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled byother memes.Of course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated withsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because ofthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thingbecause of the number of people who have caught it."Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?"There are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just afew of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in somereligions.   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to   find it.   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.   Make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.   It's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change   yourself.   Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.   If you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.   Don't believe things just because you want them to be true.   All beliefs should be open to question.Thanks for taking the time to read this article.mathew-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----iQCVAgUBK AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY g ge Mo wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO ltVtMVTu  Nz sBbPw QkbjArbY/S sZ NF htdii R SsEyPl R / bV okE/qnihqnzXE pGvLt tlez EoeHZjXLEFrdEyPVayT  yQqGb HARbOEHDcrTe atmPq Z hSSPpAU==q V -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----For information about PGP  . , send mail to pgpinfo@mantis.co.uk.√ø-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----                          An Introduction to Atheism                       by mathew <mathew@mantis.co.uk>This article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism.  Whilst Ihave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, youshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  Iwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; somerelevant books are listed in a companion article.To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this articleas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All thequestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been croppedup repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some otherfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questionsposed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflectquestions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christianswho proselytize on alt.atheism.So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such asChristianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divinebeing.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of itmay not."What is atheism?"Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former isoften referred to as the "weak atheist" position, and the latter as "strongatheism".It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  "Weakatheism" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  "Strongatheism" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do notfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are "strong atheists".Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit theiratheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than makingflat-out denials."But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?"Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believeit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent tobelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true ornot.  Which brings us to agnosticism."What is agnosticism then?"The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of theMetaphysical Society in     .  He defined an agnostic as someone whodisclaimed ("strong") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of thingsmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know forsure whether God exists.Words are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming thatyou can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the factthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many peopleuse agnosticism to mean "weak atheism", and use the word "atheism" only whenreferring to "strong atheism".Beware also that because the word "atheist" has so many shades of meaning, itis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say forsure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn'tthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find outabout the universe."So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?"There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why aparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religionsis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible thatsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because theysee no evidence that God exists."But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?"There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it isquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger thanall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objectsobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarlywell-defined is a matter for debate.However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provablyimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence ofGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible toshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.If on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing inquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalidmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thingmight be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search isoften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largestprimes, because we can prove that they don't exist.Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not existunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most ofthe time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusivelyprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot betested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be toprove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes bydefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of Godexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to covervarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst itmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may bepossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religiousbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God describedby any present-day religion exists.In practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is veryclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently differentthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind ofGod are not really applicable."But what if God is essentially non-detectable?"If God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interactionmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must bedetectable.If God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that hedoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would arguethat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of noimportance whether he exists or not.If the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.Surely he should still be detectable today?Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientificallyverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive someeffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish himfrom all the other things that don't exist?"OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but isn't it still a religious belief?"One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is "thePerson A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points outthat it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in thestatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  Hethen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed toit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an "agreed fact", butuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscureredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seento be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.The point of this digression is that the answer to the question "Isn'tatheism a religious belief?" depends crucially upon what is meant by"religious".  "Religion" is generally characterized by belief in a superhumancontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith andworship.[ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not  "religion" according to such a definition. ]Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is itcategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of"religious" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects ofhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as "religious" as well -- such asscience, politics, and watching TV."OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is still just an act of faith, like religion is?"Firstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something oneactually believes in.Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions tomake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheiststry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject toquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generallyassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These arethe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called"acts of faith", then almost everything we know must be said to be based onacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.Faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.According to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts offaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic asreligious followers when claiming that something is "certain".  This is not ageneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant tostate with certainty that the universe exists.Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.Sceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheismhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, aseven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (orthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist."If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?"It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either "for" or"against", "friend" or "enemy".  The truth is not so clear-cut.Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,it can be said to be "anti-religion".  However, when religious believersspeak of atheists being "anti-religious" they usually mean that the atheistshave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.Most atheists take a "live and let live" attitude.  Unless questioned, theywill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Ofcourse, this may be in part because atheism is not "socially acceptable" inmany countries.A few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to "convert" otherswhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made littleimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.of church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free toworship as they wished.  The institution of "state atheism" came about whenStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches inorder to gain complete power over the population.)Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they seereligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,the government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned thatchurch and state should remain separate."But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state, surely that's the same as state atheism?"The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shallnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, itmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense ofanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious innature.Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  Forexample, religious believers have historically been responsible forencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizationscampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded asreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheistsare quite happy to see them have their say."What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people pray?"Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do thingsthat those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer inschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that theyneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief meansthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will beacceptable to all those present at any public event.Also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonableto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without othermotives."You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't atheists object to the religious charities?"There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists cancontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, forthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary workfor charities founded on a theistic basis.Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about inconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everydaymatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to sayself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular setof religious beliefs.To "weak" atheists, building a hospital to say "I do not believe in God" is arather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say "Today is not mybirthday".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical."You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?"Perhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt toforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those peoplechoose to call themselves atheists.It's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as abacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On theother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to theexpectations of others.On the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion arebacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to goalong with a group rather than act or think independently."How do atheists differ from religious people?"They don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer aVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,they may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (ManyBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copyof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!Whoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists withoutrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour andappearance."Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?"That depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of courseatheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when onetalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable ("right") and unacceptable("wrong") behaviour within society.Humans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they mustco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage mostatheists from "anti-social" or "immoral" behaviour, purely for the purposesof self-preservation.Many atheists behave in a "moral" or "compassionate" way simply because theyfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they carewhat happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.Naturally, there are some people who behave "immorally" and try to useatheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people whobehave "immorally" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,   be honor and glory forever and ever."The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February   th     by Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,Wisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is areligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior   deteriorated after "born again" experiences.  While only  % of respondents   said they had driven intoxicated before being "born again,"   % had done   so after conversion.  Similarly,  % had used illegal drugs before   conversion,  % after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex   before salvation;  % after.                                ["Freethought Today", September     , p.   .]So it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moralbehaviour."Is there such a thing as atheist morality?"If you mean "Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?", then theanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about moralitywhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.If you mean "Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?", then the answeris no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a personwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same "moral rules" as theists,but for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created byhumans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, ratherthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being."Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?"A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over   % of theatheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work forthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatiblewith what they observed around them.Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they areunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent timestudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They havemade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.This decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of thatindividual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choiceof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the onlychoice that person can honestly make."But don't atheists want to believe in God?"Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Manyof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the"Big Brother" figure might be.Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Shouldone believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks ofsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting tobelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief."But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are unwilling in their souls to see!"Many, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explainedabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that Godexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.Of course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming thatall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.Comments such as "Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properly"are likely to be viewed as patronizing.Certainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it isvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they arebeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are notwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate isfutile."Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?"Many atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think givesmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their livescount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on otherpeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life topolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.It is a natural human tendency to look for "meaning" or "purpose" in randomevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that "life" is the sort of thingthat has a "meaning".To put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actuallya sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking "What is themeaning of life?" is as silly as asking "What is the meaning of a cup ofcoffee?".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is."So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?"There are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.Or on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but sowhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, orshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?In the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists areunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely becauseit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and considerthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's justhard luck."Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?"The short answer is "No, do you?"Many atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered manyarguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they havefound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.Thousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof ofthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikelyto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it."So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments apply?"No, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism isthe sceptical "default position" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheismis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefsbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,but to everyone else."What sort of harm?"Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's notjust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;think of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.Imagine how that effort could be better spent.Many theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instancesof ill people being "healed" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicinesprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have diedbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.It is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- andcondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in manythird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather thanallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a differentreligion."Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some sort of excuse."What makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hardconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fightand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REALChristian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like theCatholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?In the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone whocalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify hisactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christiansare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely ifthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't bemuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he havemade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefsaren't a perversion of what your God intended?If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then whyshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?Sorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murderedothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him aChristian."Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense."That does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently muchharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicornsdon't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default thanit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, "weak" atheistswould argue that asserting nothing is better still."Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?"Unfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how "correct"it is, or whether it "works"; consider how many people believe in astrology,graphology, and other pseudo-sciences.Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe ingods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows thepeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.Of course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even whenthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have startedas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves otherpurposes as well."But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say something?"Not really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it'sworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort ofconcept of God in the Christian sense.Of course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it'srather odd to use one religion to try and justify another."What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded that God exists?"For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one whodoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief isnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important torealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in thesame way that theists view their religious leaders.A famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, butwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Manyrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking onsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise."So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothing?"Not entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question hasproperties which have helped it so spread so far.The theory of memetics talks of "memes" -- sets of ideas which can propagatethemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists viewreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread byencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction bydiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressureto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Somereligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled byother memes.Of course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated withsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because ofthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thingbecause of the number of people who have caught it."Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?"There are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just afew of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in somereligions.   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to   find it.   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.   Make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.   It's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change   yourself.   Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.   If you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.   Don't believe things just because you want them to be true.   All beliefs should be open to question.Thanks for taking the time to read this article.mathew-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----iQCVAgUBK AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY g ge Mo wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO ltVtMVTu  Nz

introduction to atheism  Whilst Ihave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues youshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint  Iwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions somerelevant books are listed in a companion articleTo provide a sense of cohesion and progression I have presented this articleas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist  All thequestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been croppedup repeatedly on altatheism since the newsgroup was created  Some otherfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion articlePlease note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questionsposed from a Christian viewpoint  This is because the FAQ files reflectquestions which have actually been asked and it is predominantly Christianswho proselytize on altatheismSo when I talk of religion I am talking primarily about religions such asChristianity Judaism and Islam which involve some sort of superhuman divinebeing  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions but some of itmay notWhat is atheismAtheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of GodSome atheists go further and believe that God does not exist  The former isoften referred to as the weak atheist position and the latter as strongatheismIt is important to note the difference between these two positions  Weakatheism is simple scepticism disbelief in the existence of God  Strongatheism is a positive belief that God does not exist  Please do notfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are strong atheistsSome atheists believe in the nonexistence of all Gods others limit theiratheism to specific Gods such as the Christian God rather than makingflatout denialsBut isnt disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesnt existDefinitely not  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believeit to be true  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent tobelieving that it is false one may simply have no idea whether it is true ornot  Which brings us to agnosticismWhat is agnosticism thenThe term agnosticism was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of theMetaphysical Society in       He defined an agnostic as someone whodisclaimed strong atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of thingsmust be some cause unknown and unknowableThus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know forsure whether God existsWords are slippery things and language is inexact  Beware of assuming thatyou can work out someones philosophical point of view simply from the factthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic  For example many peopleuse agnosticism to mean weak atheism and use the word atheism only whenreferring to strong atheismBeware also that because the word atheist has so many shades of meaning itis very difficult to generalize about atheists  About all you can say forsure is that atheists dont believe in God  For example it certainly isntthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find outabout the universeSo what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheismThere are many philosophical justifications for atheism  To find out why aparticular person chooses to be an atheist its best to ask herMany atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religionsis essentially selfcontradictory and that it is logically impossible thatsuch a God could exist  Others are atheists through scepticism because theysee no evidence that God existsBut isnt it impossible to prove the nonexistence of somethingThere are many counterexamples to such a statement  For example it isquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger thanall other prime numbers  Of course this deals with welldefined objectsobeying welldefined rules  Whether Gods or universes are similarlywelldefined is a matter for debateHowever assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provablyimpossible there are still subtle reasons for assuming the nonexistence ofGod  If we assume that something does not exist it is always possible toshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counterexampleIf on the other hand we assume that something does exist and if the thing inquestion is not provably impossible showing that the assumption is invalidmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thingmight be found to show that it isnt there  Such an exhaustive search isoften impractical or impossible  There is no such problem with largestprimes because we can prove that they dont existTherefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not existunless we have evidence that they do  Even theists follow this rule most ofthe time they dont believe in unicorns even though they cant conclusivelyprove that no unicorns exist anywhereTo assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot betested  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be toprove that he doesnt exist anywhere  So the sceptical atheist assumes bydefault that God does not exist since that is an assumption we can testThose who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of Godexists instead they generally restrict their claims so as to covervarieties of God described by followers of various religions  So whilst itmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists it may bepossible to prove that say a God as described by a particular religiousbook does not exist  It may even be possible to prove that no God describedby any presentday religion existsIn practice believing that no God described by any religion exists is veryclose to believing that no God exists  However it is sufficiently differentthat counterarguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind ofGod are not really applicableBut what if God is essentially nondetectableIf God interacts with our universe in any way the effects of his interactionmust be measurable  Hence his interaction with our universe must bedetectableIf God is essentially nondetectable it must therefore be the case that hedoes not interact with our universe in any way  Many atheists would arguethat if God does not interact with our universe at all it is of noimportance whether he exists or notIf the Bible is to be believed God was easily detectable by the IsraelitesSurely he should still be detectable todayNote that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientificallyverifiable physical way  It must surely be possible to perceive someeffect caused by his presence though otherwise how can I distinguish himfrom all the other things that dont existOK you may think theres a philosophical justification for atheism but isnt it still a religious beliefOne of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is thePerson A begins by making a contentious statement  When person B points outthat it cant be true person A gradually redefines the words he used in thestatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept  Hethen records the statement along with the fact that person B has agreed toit and continues  Eventually A uses the statement as an agreed fact butuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscureredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it  Rather than be seento be apparently inconsistent B will tend to play alongThe point of this digression is that the answer to the question Isntatheism a religious belief depends crucially upon what is meant byreligious  Religion is generally characterized by belief in a superhumancontrolling power  especially in some sort of God  and by faith andworship Its worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not  religion according to such a definition Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power nor is itcategorized by worship in any meaningful sense  Widening the definition ofreligious to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects ofhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as religious as well  such asscience politics and watching TVOK so its not a religion  But surely belief in atheism or science is still just an act of faith like religion isFirstly its not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something oneactually believes inSecondly it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions tomake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience  Most atheiststry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible and even those are subject toquestioning if experience throws them into doubtScience has a number of core assumptions  For example it is generallyassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers  These arethe sort of core assumptions atheists make  If such basic ideas are calledacts of faith then almost everything we know must be said to be based onacts of faith and the term loses its meaningFaith is more often used to refer to complete certain belief in somethingAccording to such a definition atheism and science are certainly not acts offaith  Of course individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic asreligious followers when claiming that something is certain  This is not ageneral tendency however there are many atheists who would be reluctant tostate with certainty that the universe existsFaith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proofSceptical atheism certainly doesnt fit that definition as sceptical atheismhas no beliefs  Strong atheism is closer but still doesnt really match aseven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data orthe lack of it when asserting that God does not existIf atheism is not religious surely its antireligiousIt is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either for oragainst friend or enemy  The truth is not so clearcutAtheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism in that senseit can be said to be antireligion  However when religious believersspeak of atheists being antireligious they usually mean that the atheistshave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theistsThis categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfairAtheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrumMost atheists take a live and let live attitude  Unless questioned theywill not usually mention their atheism except perhaps to close friends  Ofcourse this may be in part because atheism is not socially acceptable inmany countriesA few atheists are quite antireligious and may even try to convert otherswhen possible  Historically such antireligious atheists have made littleimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countriesof church and state just like the USA  Soviet citizens were legally free toworship as they wished  The institution of state atheism came about whenStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches inorder to gain complete power over the populationSome atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs but only where they seereligion encroaching on matters which are not its business  for examplethe government of the USA  Such individuals are usually concerned thatchurch and state should remain separateBut if you dont allow religion to have a say in the running of the state surely thats the same as state atheismThe principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shallnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief  In particular itmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense ofanother but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious innatureReligions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters  Forexample religious believers have historically been responsible forencouraging many political reforms  Even today many organizationscampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded asreligious campaigns  So long as they campaign concerning secular mattersand so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds most atheistsare quite happy to see them have their sayWhat about prayer in schools If theres no God why do you care if people prayBecause people who do pray are voters and lawmakers and tend to do thingsthat those who dont pray cant just ignore  Also Christian prayer inschools is intimidating to nonChristians even if they are told that theyneed not join in  The diversity of religious and nonreligious belief meansthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will beacceptable to all those present at any public eventAlso nonprayers tend to have friends and family who pray  It is reasonableto care about friends and family wasting their time even without othermotivesYou mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid  What about atheists  Why arent there any atheist charities or hospitals  Dont atheists object to the religious charitiesThere are many charities without religious purpose that atheists cancontribute to  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well forthe sake of the practical good they do  Some atheists even do voluntary workfor charities founded on a theistic basisMost atheists seem to feel that atheism isnt worth shouting about inconnection with charity  To them atheism is just a simple obvious everydaymatter and so is charity  Many feel that its somewhat cheap not to sayselfrighteous to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular setof religious beliefsTo weak atheists building a hospital to say I do not believe in God is arather strange idea its rather like holding a party to say Today is not mybirthday  Why the fuss  Atheism is rarely evangelicalYou said atheism isnt antireligious  But is it perhaps a backlash against ones upbringing a way of rebellingPerhaps it is for some  But many people have parents who do not attempt toforce any religious or atheist ideas upon them and many of those peoplechoose to call themselves atheistsIts also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as abacklash against an atheist upbringing as a way of being different  On theother hand many people choose religion as a way of conforming to theexpectations of othersOn the whole we cant conclude much about whether atheism or religion arebacklash or conformism although in general people have a tendency to goalong with a group rather than act or think independentlyHow do atheists differ from religious peopleThey dont believe in God  Thats all there is to itAtheists may listen to heavy metal  backwards even  or they may prefer aVerdi Requiem even if they know the words  They may wear Hawaiian shirtsthey may dress all in black they may even wear orange robes  ManyBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God  Some atheists even carry a copyof the Bible around  for arguing against of courseWhoever you are the chances are you have met several atheists withoutrealising it  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour andappearanceUnexceptional But arent atheists less moral than religious peopleThat depends  If you define morality as obedience to God then of courseatheists are less moral as they dont obey any God  But usually when onetalks of morality one talks of what is acceptable right and unacceptablewrong behaviour within societyHumans are social animals and to be maximally successful they mustcooperate with each other  This is a good enough reason to discourage mostatheists from antisocial or immoral behaviour purely for the purposesof selfpreservationMany atheists behave in a moral or compassionate way simply because theyfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans  So why do they carewhat happens to others  They dont know they simply are that wayNaturally there are some people who behave immorally and try to useatheism to justify their actions  However there are equally many people whobehave immorally and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their   came into the world to save sinners  But for that very reason I was   shown mercy so that in me  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive   eternal life  Now to the king eternal immortal invisible the only God   be honor and glory forever and everThe above quote is from a statement made to the court on February   th     by Jeffrey Dahmer the notorious cannibal serial killer of MilwaukeeWisconsin  It seems that for every atheist massmurderer there is areligious massmurderer  But what of more trivial morality   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior   deteriorated after born again experiences  While only   of respondents   said they had driven intoxicated before being born again    had done   so after conversion  Similarly   had used illegal drugs before   conversion   after  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex   before salvation   after                                Freethought Today September      p   So it seems that at best religion does not have a monopoly on moralbehaviourIs there such a thing as atheist moralityIf you mean Is there such a thing as morality for atheists then theanswer is yes as explained above  Many atheists have ideas about moralitywhich are at least as strong as those held by religious peopleIf you mean Does atheism have a characteristic moral code then the answeris no  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a personwill behave  Most atheists follow many of the same moral rules as theistsbut for different reasons  Atheists view morality as something created byhumans according to the way humans feel the world ought to work ratherthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural beingThen arent atheists just theists who are denying GodA study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over    of theatheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work forthem  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatiblewith what they observed around themAtheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial they areunbelievers through choice  The vast majority of them have spent timestudying one or more religions sometimes in very great depth  They havemade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefsThis decision may of course be an inevitable consequence of thatindividuals personality  For a naturally sceptical person the choiceof atheism is often the only one that makes sense and hence the onlychoice that person can honestly makeBut dont atheists want to believe in GodAtheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them  Manyof them have no desire to be watched over no matter how goodnatured theBig Brother figure might beSome atheists would like to be able to believe in God  but so what Shouldone believe things merely because one wants them to be true  The risks ofsuch an approach should be obvious  Atheists often decide that wanting tobelieve something is not enough there must be evidence for the beliefBut of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God  they are unwilling in their souls to seeMany if not most atheists were previously religious  As has been explainedabove the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that Godexists  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach GodOf course it is true that some atheists lack an open mind but assuming thatall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closedmindedComments such as Of course God is there you just arent looking properlyare likely to be viewed as patronizingCertainly if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it isvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they arebeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God  If you are notwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth debate isfutileIsnt the whole of life completely pointless to an atheistMany atheists live a purposeful life  They decide what they think givesmeaning to life and they pursue those goals  They try to make their livescount not by wishing for eternal life but by having an influence on otherpeople who will live on  For example an atheist may dedicate his life topolitical reform in the hope of leaving his mark on historyIt is a natural human tendency to look for meaning or purpose in randomevents  However it is by no means obvious that life is the sort of thingthat has a meaningTo put it another way not everything which looks like a question is actuallya sensible thing to ask  Some atheists believe that asking What is themeaning of life is as silly as asking What is the meaning of a cup ofcoffee  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning it just isSo how do atheists find comfort in time of dangerThere are many ways of obtaining comfort from family friends or even petsOr on a less spiritual level from food or drink or TVThat may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger but sowhat  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting orshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might beIn the end its a decision for the individual concerned  Most atheists areunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely becauseit makes them feel comfortable  They put truth before comfort and considerthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy thats justhard luckDont atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrongThe short answer is No do youMany atheists have been atheists for years  They have encountered manyarguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God but they havefound all of it to be invalid or inconclusiveThousands of years of religious belief havent resulted in any good proof ofthe existence of God  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikelyto be proved wrong in the immediate future and they stop worrying about itSo why should theists question their beliefs Dont the same arguments applyNo because the beliefs being questioned are not similar  Weak atheism isthe sceptical default position to take it asserts nothing  Strong atheismis a negative belief  Theism is a very strong positive beliefAtheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefsbecause of the very real harm they can cause  not just to the believersbut to everyone elseWhat sort of harmReligion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind  Its notjust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildingsthink of all the time and effort spent building churches praying and so onImagine how that effort could be better spentMany theists believe in miracle healing  There have been plenty of instancesof ill people being healed by a priest ceasing to take the medicinesprescribed to them by doctors and dying as a result  Some theists have diedbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious groundsIt is arguable that the Catholic Churchs opposition to birth control  andcondoms in particular  is increasing the problem of overpopulation in

whodisclaimed strong atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of thingsmust be some cause unknown and unknowablethus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know forsure whether god existswords are slippery things and language is inexact beware of assuming thatyou can work out someones philosophical point of view simply from the factthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic for example many peopleuse agnosticism to mean weak atheism and use the word atheism only whenreferring to strong atheismbeware also that because the word atheist has so many shades of meaning itis very difficult to generalize about atheists about all you can say forsure is that atheists dont believe in god for example it certainly isntthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find outabout the universeso what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheismthere are many philosophical justifications for atheism to find out why aparticular person chooses to be an atheist its best to ask hermany atheists feel that the idea of god as presented by the major religionsis essentially selfcontradictory and that it is logically impossible thatsuch a god could exist others are atheists through scepticism because theysee no evidence that god existsbut isnt it impossible to prove the nonexistence of somethingthere are many counterexamples to such a statement for example it isquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger thanall other prime numbers of course this deals with welldefined objectsobeying welldefined rules whether gods or universes are similarlywelldefined is a matter for debatehowever assuming for the moment that the existence of a god is not provablyimpossible there are still subtle reasons for assuming the nonexistence ofgod if we assume that something does not exist it is always possible toshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counterexampleif on the other hand we assume that something does exist and if the thing inquestion is not provably impossible showing that the assumption is invalidmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thingmight be found to show that it isnt there such an exhaustive search isoften impractical or impossible there is no such problem with largestprimes because we can prove that they dont existtherefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not existunless we have evidence that they do even theists follow this rule most ofthe time they dont believe in unicorns even though they cant conclusivelyprove that no unicorns exist anywhereto assume that god exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot betested we cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere god might be toprove that he doesnt exist anywhere so the sceptical atheist assumes bydefault that god does not exist since that is an assumption we can testthose who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of godexists instead they generally restrict their claims so as to covervarieties of god described by followers of various religions so whilst itmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no god exists it may bepossible to prove that say a god as described by a particular religiousbook does not exist it may even be possible to prove that no god describedby any presentday religion existsin practice believing that no god described by any religion exists is veryclose to believing that no god exists however it is sufficiently differentthat counterarguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind ofgod are not really applicablebut what if god is essentially nondetectableif god interacts with our universe in any way the effects of his interactionmust be measurable hence his interaction with our universe must bedetectableif god is essentially nondetectable it must therefore be the case that hedoes not interact with our universe in any way many atheists would arguethat if god does not interact with our universe at all it is of noimportance whether he exists or notif the bible is to be believed god was easily detectable by the israelitessurely he should still be detectable todaynote that i am not demanding that god interact in a scientificallyverifiable physical way it must surely be possible to perceive someeffect caused by his presence though otherwise how can i distinguish himfrom all the other things that dont existok you may think theres a philosophical justification for atheism but isnt it still a religious beliefone of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is theperson a begins by making a contentious statement when person b points outthat it cant be true person a gradually redefines the words he used in thestatement until he arrives at something person b is prepared to accept hethen records the statement along with the fact that person b has agreed toit and continues eventually a uses the statement as an agreed fact butuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscureredefinitions originally needed to get b to agree to it rather than be seento be apparently inconsistent b will tend to play alongthe point of this digression is that the answer to the question isntatheism a religious belief depends crucially upon what is meant byreligious religion is generally characterized by belief in a superhumancontrolling power especially in some sort of god and by faith andworship its worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of buddhism are not religion according to such a definition atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power nor is itcategorized by worship in any meaningful sense widening the definition ofreligious to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects ofhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as religious as well such asscience politics and watching tvok so its not a religion but surely belief in atheism or science is still just an act of faith like religion isfirstly its not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something oneactually believes insecondly it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions tomake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience most atheiststry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible and even those are subject toquestioning if experience throws them into doubtscience has a number of core assumptions for example it is generallyassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers these arethe sort of core assumptions atheists make if such basic ideas are calledacts of faith then almost everything we know must be said to be based onacts of faith and the term loses its meaningfaith is more often used to refer to complete certain belief in somethingaccording to such a definition atheism and science are certainly not acts offaith of course individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic asreligious followers when claiming that something is certain this is not ageneral tendency however there are many atheists who would be reluctant tostate with certainty that the universe existsfaith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proofsceptical atheism certainly doesnt fit that definition as sceptical atheismhas no beliefs strong atheism is closer but still doesnt really match aseven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data orthe lack of it when asserting that god does not existif atheism is not religious surely its antireligiousit is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either for oragainst friend or enemy the truth is not so clearcutatheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism in that senseit can be said to be antireligion however when religious believersspeak of atheists being antireligious they usually mean that the atheistshave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theiststhis categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfairatheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrummost atheists take a live and let live attitude unless questioned theywill not usually mention their atheism except perhaps to close friends ofcourse this may be in part because atheism is not socially acceptable inmany countriesa few atheists are quite antireligious and may even try to convert otherswhen possible historically such antireligious atheists have made littleimpact on society outside the eastern bloc countriesof church and state just like the usa soviet citizens were legally free toworship as they wished the institution of state atheism came about whenstalin took control of the soviet union and tried to destroy the churches inorder to gain complete power over the populationsome atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs but only where they seereligion encroaching on matters which are not its business for examplethe government of the usa such individuals are usually concerned thatchurch and state should remain separatebut if you dont allow religion to have a say in the running of the state surely thats the same as state atheismthe principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shallnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief in particular itmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense ofanother but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious innaturereligions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters forexample religious believers have historically been responsible forencouraging many political reforms even today many organizationscampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded asreligious campaigns so long as they campaign concerning secular mattersand so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds most atheistsare quite happy to see them have their saywhat about prayer in schools if theres no god why do you care if people praybecause people who do pray are voters and lawmakers and tend to do thingsthat those who dont pray cant just ignore also christian prayer inschools is intimidating to nonchristians even if they are told that theyneed not join in the diversity of religious and nonreligious belief meansthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will beacceptable to all those present at any public eventalso nonprayers tend to have friends and family who pray it is reasonableto care about friends and family wasting their time even without othermotivesyou mentioned christians who campaign for increased foreign aid what about atheists why arent there any atheist charities or hospitals dont atheists object to the religious charitiesthere are many charities without religious purpose that atheists cancontribute to some atheists contribute to religious charities as well forthe sake of the practical good they do some atheists even do voluntary workfor charities founded on a theistic basismost atheists seem to feel that atheism isnt worth shouting about inconnection with charity to them atheism is just a simple obvious everydaymatter and so is charity many feel that its somewhat cheap not to sayselfrighteous to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular setof religious beliefsto weak atheists building a hospital to say i do not believe in god is arather strange idea its rather like holding a party to say today is not mybirthday why the fuss atheism is rarely evangelicalyou said atheism isnt antireligious but is it perhaps a backlash against ones upbringing a way of rebellingperhaps it is for some but many people have parents who do not attempt toforce any religious or atheist ideas upon them and many of those peoplechoose to call themselves atheistsits also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as abacklash against an atheist upbringing as a way of being different on theother hand many people choose religion as a way of conforming to theexpectations of otherson the whole we cant conclude much about whether atheism or religion arebacklash or conformism although in general people have a tendency to goalong with a group rather than act or think independentlyhow do atheists differ from religious peoplethey dont believe in god thats all there is to itatheists may listen to heavy metal backwards even or they may prefer averdi requiem even if they know the words they may wear hawaiian shirtsthey may dress all in black they may even wear orange robes manybuddhists lack a belief in any sort of god some atheists even carry a copyof the bible around for arguing against of coursewhoever you are the chances are you have met several atheists withoutrealising it atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour andappearanceunexceptional but arent atheists less moral than religious peoplethat depends if you define morality as obedience to god then of courseatheists are less moral as they dont obey any god but usually when onetalks of morality one talks of what is acceptable right and unacceptablewrong behaviour within societyhumans are social animals and to be maximally successful they mustcooperate with each other this is a good enough reason to discourage mostatheists from antisocial or immoral behaviour purely for the purposesof selfpreservationmany atheists behave in a moral or compassionate way simply because theyfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans so why do they carewhat happens to others they dont know they simply are that waynaturally there are some people who behave immorally and try to useatheism to justify their actions however there are equally many people whobehave immorally and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their came into the world to save sinners but for that very reason i was shown mercy so that in me jesus christ might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life now to the king eternal immortal invisible the only god be honor and glory forever and everthe above quote is from a statement made to the court on february th by jeffrey dahmer the notorious cannibal serial killer of milwaukeewisconsin it seems that for every atheist massmurderer there is areligious massmurderer but what of more trivial morality a survey conducted by the roper organization found that behavior deteriorated after born again experiences while only of respondents said they had driven intoxicated before being born again had done so after conversion similarly had used illegal drugs before conversion after two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex before salvation after freethought today september p so it seems that at best religion does not have a monopoly on moralbehaviouris there such a thing as atheist moralityif you mean is there such a thing as morality for atheists then theanswer is yes as explained above many atheists have ideas about moralitywhich are at least as strong as those held by religious peopleif you mean does atheism have a characteristic moral code then the answeris no atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a personwill behave most atheists follow many of the same moral rules as theistsbut for different reasons atheists view morality as something created byhumans according to the way humans feel the world ought to work ratherthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural beingthen arent atheists just theists who are denying goda study by the freedom from religion foundation found that over of theatheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work forthem they had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatiblewith what they observed around thematheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial they areunbelievers through choice the vast majority of them have spent timestudying one or more religions sometimes in very great depth they havemade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefsthis decision may of course be an inevitable consequence of thatindividuals personality for a naturally sceptical person the choiceof atheism is often the only one that makes sense and hence the onlychoice that person can honestly makebut dont atheists want to believe in godatheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them manyof them have no desire to be watched over no matter how goodnatured thebig brother figure might besome atheists would like to be able to believe in god but so what shouldone believe things merely because one wants them to be true the risks ofsuch an approach should be obvious atheists often decide that wanting tobelieve something is not enough there must be evidence for the beliefbut of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of god they are unwilling in their souls to seemany if not most atheists were previously religious as has been explainedabove the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that godexists many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach godof course it is true that some atheists lack an open mind but assuming thatall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closedmindedcomments such as of course god is there you just arent looking properlyare likely to be viewed as patronizingcertainly if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it isvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they arebeing sincere if they say that they have searched for god if you are notwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth debate isfutileisnt the whole of life completely pointless to an atheistmany atheists live a purposeful life they decide what they think givesmeaning to life and they pursue those goals they try to make their livescount not by wishing for eternal life but by having an influence on otherpeople who will live on for example an atheist may dedicate his life topolitical reform in the hope of leaving his mark on historyit is a natural human tendency to look for meaning or purpose in randomevents however it is by no means obvious that life is the sort of thingthat has a meaningto put it another way not everything which looks like a question is actuallya sensible thing to ask some atheists believe that asking what is themeaning of life is as silly as asking what is the meaning of a cup ofcoffee they believe that life has no purpose or meaning it just isso how do atheists find comfort in time of dangerthere are many ways of obtaining comfort from family friends or even petsor on a less spiritual level from food or drink or tvthat may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger but sowhat should individuals believe in things because they are comforting orshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might bein the end its a decision for the individual concerned most atheists areunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely becauseit makes them feel comfortable they put truth before comfort and considerthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy thats justhard luckdont atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrongthe short answer is no do youmany atheists have been atheists for years they have encountered manyarguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of god but they havefound all of it to be invalid or inconclusivethousands of years of religious belief havent resulted in any good proof ofthe existence of god atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikelyto be proved wrong in the immediate future and they stop worrying about itso why should theists question their beliefs dont the same arguments applyno because the beliefs being questioned are not similar weak atheism isthe sceptical default position to take it asserts nothing strong atheismis a negative belief theism is a very strong positive beliefatheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefsbecause of the very real harm they can cause not just to the believersbut to everyone elsewhat sort of harmreligion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind its notjust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildingsthink of all the time and effort spent building churches praying and so onimagine how that effort could be better spentmany theists believe in miracle healing there have been plenty of instancesof ill people being healed by a priest ceasing to take the medicinesprescribed to them by doctors and dying as a result some theists have diedbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious groundsit is arguable that the catholic churchs opposition to birth control andcondoms in particular is increasing the problem of overpopulation in manythirdworld countries and contributing to the spread of aids worldwidereligious believers have been known to murder their children rather thanallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a differentreligionthose werent real believers they just claimed to be believers as some sort of excusewhat makes a real believer there are so many one true religions its hardconvinced that they are the only true christians sometimes they even fightand kill each other how is an atheist supposed to decide whos a realchristian and who isnt when even the major christian churches like thecatholic church and the church of england cant decide amongst themselvesin the end most atheists take a pragmatic view and decide that anyone whocalls himself a christian and uses christian belief or dogma to justify hisactions should be considered a christian maybe some of those christiansare just perverting christian teaching for their own ends but surely ifthe bible can be so readily used to support unchristian acts it cant bemuch of a moral code if the bible is the word of god why couldnt he havemade it less easy to misinterpret and how do you know that your beliefsarent a perversion of what your god intendedif there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the bible then whyshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your saysosorry but if someone claims that he believes in jesus and that he murderedothers because jesus and the bible told him to do so we must call him achristianobviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned but since nobody has ever proved that god does not exist it must be very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs shared by all faiths are nonsensethat does not hold because as was pointed out at the start of this dialoguepositive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently muchharder to disprove than negative ones nobody has ever proved that unicornsdont exist but that doesnt make it unlikely that they are mythsit is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default thanit is to hold a positive assertion by default of course weak atheistswould argue that asserting nothing is better stillwell if atheisms so great why are there so many theistsunfortunately the popularity of a belief has little to do with how correctit is or whether it works consider how many people believe in astrologygraphology and other pseudosciencesmany atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe ingods certainly in many primitive human societies religion allows thepeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understandof course theres more to religion than that in the industrialized worldwe find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even whenthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations religion may have startedas a means of attempting to explain the world but nowadays it serves otherpurposes as wellbut so many cultures have developed religions surely that must say somethingnot really most religions are only superficially similar for example itsworth remembering that religions such as buddhism and taoism lack any sort ofconcept of god in the christian senseof course most religions are quick to denounce competing religions so itsrather odd to use one religion to try and justify anotherwhat about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded that god existsfor every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god there is one whodoes not besides as has already been pointed out the truth of a belief isnot determined by how many people believe it also it is important torealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in thesame way that theists view their religious leadersa famous scientist is only human she may be an expert in some fields butwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight manyrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking onsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertiseso are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothingnot entirely it certainly indicates that the religion in question hasproperties which have helped it so spread so farthe theory of memetics talks of memes sets of ideas which can propagatethemselves between human minds by analogy with genes some atheists viewreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes which spread byencouraging their hosts to convert others some memes avoid destruction bydiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine or by using peer pressureto keep onetime believers from admitting that they were mistaken somereligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled byother memesof course in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated withsuccessful propagation of a meme religion is not a good thing because ofthe number of people who believe it any more than a disease is a good thingbecause of the number of people who have caught iteven if religion is not entirely true at least it puts across important messages what are the fundamental messages of atheismthere are many important ideas atheists promote the following are just afew of them dont be surprised to see ideas which are also present in somereligions there is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules be especially sceptical of positive claims if you want your life to have some sort of meaning its up to you to find it search for what is true even if it makes you uncomfortable make the most of your life as its probably the only one youll have its no good relying on some external power to change you you must change yourself just because somethings popular doesnt mean its good if you must assume something assume something its easy to test dont believe things just because you want them to be true all beliefs should be open to questionthanks for taking

The style and languagetogether with the theology are usually used as counterargument. The argument that John was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospelof John itself.

BenediktIn article      mimsyumdedu Well John has a quite different not necessarily more elaborated theologyThere is some evidence that he must have known Luke and that the contentof Q was known to him but not in a canonized formThis is a new argument to me  Could you elaborate a little the almost codified way they were in Matthew or Luke However they areconsidered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of Q as such andnot an entirely different source  Assuming that he knew Luke would obviously put him after Luke and wouldgive evidence for the latter assumptionI dont think this follows  If you take the most traditional attributionsthen Luke might have known John but John is an elder figure in either caseWere talking spans of time here which are well within the range oflifetimes We
